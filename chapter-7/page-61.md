quickly
 
summarize
 
long
 
financial
 
documents
 
(like
 
annual
 
reports
 
or
 
income
 
statements)
 
into
 
key
 
points,
 
highlighting
 
important
 
figures,
 
trends,
 
and
 
insights
 
without
 
reading
 
the
 
entire
 
report.
 
Starter

Present
 
them
 
as
 
a
 
bullet
 
list
 
with
 
brief
 
explanations.
 
Why
 
It
 
Works:
 
●
 
Gives
 
clear
 
instructions
 
(role
 
and
 
number
 
of
 
insights),
 
so
 
the
 
AI
 
knows
 
to
 
focus
 
on
 
top
 
insights
 
(examples
 
provided)
 
rather
 
than
 
give
 
a
 
generic
 
summary
 
 
●
 
Structured
 
output
 
(bullet
 
list
 
of
 
insights)
 
ensures
 
the
 
summary
 
is
 
concise
 
and
 
easy
 
to
 
scan,
 
matching
 
best
 
practices
 
for
 
executive
 
briefings.
 
Optional
 
Add-On:
 
Append
 
"Include
 
one
 
supporting
 
figure
 
for
 
each
 
insight."
 
to
 
incorporate
 
key
 
numbers
 
into
 
the
 
summary .
