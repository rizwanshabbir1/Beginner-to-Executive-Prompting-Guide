Quick-Look
 
Definition:
 
Utilizing
 
AI
 
to
 
calculate
 
key
 
financial
 
ratios
 
and
 
identify
 
trends
 
over
 
time,
 
translating
 
raw
 
numbers
 
into
 
meaningful
 
insights
 
about
 
a
 
company's
 
performance.
 
Starter
 
Prompt:
 
Explain
 
what
 
the
 
current
 
ratio
 
and
 
debt-equity
 
ratio
 
indicate
 
for
 
a
 
company
 
with
 
a
 
current
 
ratio
 
of
 
2.1
 
and
 
D/E
 
of
 
1.5.
 
Executive
 
Prompt:
 
You
 
are
 
a
 
finance
 
expert.
 
Using
 
the
 
provided
 
three-year
 
financial
 
data,
 
calculate
 
the
 
key
 
ratios
 
(profit
 
margin,
 
return
 
on
 
equity ,
 
and
 
debt-to-equity)
 
for
 
each
 
year.
 
Then,
 
describe
 
the
 
trends
 
in
 
these
 
ratios
 
and
 
what
 
they
 
indicate
 
about
 
the
 
company's
 
health.
 
Why
 
It
 
Works:
 
●
 
Combines
 
calculation
 
with
 
interpretation—explicitly
 
asking
 
for
 
numbers
 
and
 
analysis—so
 
the
 
AI
 
provides
 
context
 
rather
 
than
 
just
 
math.
 
●
 
Specifying
 
exact
 
ratios
 
and
 
years
 
gives
 
focus
 
and
 
ensures
 
the
 
AI
 
organizes
 
the
 
output
 
logically
 
(for
 
example,
 
by
 
year
 
or
 
by
 
ratio).
 
Optional
 
Add-On:
 
Add
 
"Present
 
the
 
ratios
 
in
 
a
 
table
 
before
 
the
 
analysis."
 
to
 
get
 
a
 
clear
 
numeric
 
summary
 
followed
 
by
 
an
 
explanation.
