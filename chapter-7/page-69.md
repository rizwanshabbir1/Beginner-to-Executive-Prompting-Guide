Timeline
 
Quick-Look
 
Definition:
 
Visualizing
 
project
 
schedules
 
with
 
task
 
dependencies
 
and
 
durations.
 
Starter
 
Prompt:
 
Create
 
a
 
timeline
 
for
 
launching
 
a
 
new
 
product
 
in
 
the
 
third
 
quarter .
 
Executive
 
Prompt:
 
Act
 
as
 
a
 
project
 
scheduling
 
expert.
 
For
 
a
 
mobile
 
app
 
launch,
 
create
 
a
 
10-week
 
Gantt
 
chart
 
showing
 
1)
 
15-20
 
key
 
activities
 
grouped
 
by
 
department,
 
2)
 
dependencies
 
between
 
tasks,
 
3)
 
2-3
 
project
 
milestones,
 
and
 
4)
 
resource
 
allocation
 
percentages—format
 
as
 
a
 
text-based
 
chart
 
with
 
weeks
 
as
 
columns.
 
Why
 
It
 
Works:
 
●
 
Dependencies
 
force
 
realistic
 
scheduling
 
rather
 
than
 
wishful
 
thinking.
 
●
 
Resource
 
allocation
 
percentage
 
catches
 
over-commitment
 
issues
 
early .
