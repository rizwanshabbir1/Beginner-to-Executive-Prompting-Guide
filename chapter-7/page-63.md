Using
 
AI
 
to
 
model
 
financial
 
forecasts
 
under
 
different
 
scenarios
 
(best-case
 
vs.
 
worst-case),
 
helping
 
executives
 
see
 
potential
 
future
 
outcomes
 
(revenue,
 
expenses,
 
profit)
 
based
 
on
 
various
 
assumptions.
 
Starter
 
Prompt:
 
Project
 
next
 
quarter's
 
revenue
 
if
 
sales
 
grow
 
10%
 
but
 
costs
 
increase
 
5%.
 
Executive
 
Prompt:
 
You
 
are
 
a
 
financial
 
planner .
 
Using
 
our
 
current
 
quarterly
 
results,
 
create
 
two
 
forecast
 
scenarios
 
for
 
next
 
year:
 
(1)
 
Optimistic
 
--
 
10%
 
revenue
 
growth,
 
5%
 
cost
 
increase;
 
(2)
 
Conservative
 
--
 
2%
 
revenue
 
growth,
 
0%
 
cost
 
increase.
 
Calculate
 
the
 
projected
 
profit
 
for
 
each
 
scenario
 
and
 
briefly
 
explain
 
the
 
difference
 
in
 
outcomes.
 
Why
 
It
 
Works:
 
●
 
Provides
 
explicit
 
scenario
 
parameters,
 
enabling
 
the
 
AI
 
to
 
apply
 
the
 
given
 
percentages
 
directly
 
instead
 
of
 
making
 
estimates.
 
●
 
Asking
 
for
 
an
 
explanation
 
ensures
 
the
 
AI
 
goes
 
beyond
 
numbers
 
to
 
discuss
 
implications,
 
following
 
best
 
practices
 
in
 
scenario
 
planning.
 
Optional
 
Add-On:
 
Append
 
"Also
 
provide
 
a
 
brief
 
recommendation
 
based
 
on
 
these
 
scenarios."
 
to
 
get
 
actionable
 
advice.

composition
 
against
 
benchmarks
 
and
 
targets.
 
Starter
 
Prompt:
 
Please
 
review
 
my
 
investment
 
portfolio,
 
which
 
is
 
divided
 
between
 
stocks,
 
bonds,
 
and
 
cash.
 
Executive
 
Prompt:
 
As
 
a
 
CIO,
 
analyze
 
this
 
60/40
 
portfolio
 
vs
 
benchmarks:
 
1)
 
compute
 
3-yr
 
CAGR
 
&
 
stdev ,
 
2)
 
compare
 
to
 
S&P
 
500
 
and
 
AGG,
 
3)
 
recommend
 
re-weighting.
 
Provide
 
a
 
summary
 
table
 
and
 
a
 
2-sentence
 
rationale.
 
Why
 
It
 
Works:
 
●
 
Performance
 
metrics
 
(CAGR,
 
standard
 
deviation)
 
add
 
analytical
 
rigor.
 
●
 
Direct
 
benchmark
 
comparison
 
provides
 
context
 
for
 
recommendations.
