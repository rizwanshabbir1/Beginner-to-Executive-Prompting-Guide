Why
 
It
 
Works:
 
●
 
The
 
optimization
 
specialist
 
role
 
activates
 
structured
 
improvement
 
methodologies.
 
●
 
The
 
measurement
 
framework
 
ensures
 
a
 
data-driven
 
rather
 
than
 
assumption-based
 
approach.
 
●
 
Root
 
cause
 
analysis
 
focuses
 
on
 
addressing
 
underlying
 
issues
 
rather
 
than
 
symptoms.
 
●
 
Control
 
emphasis
 
prevents
 
a
 
typical
 
pattern
 
of
 
temporary
 
improvements.
