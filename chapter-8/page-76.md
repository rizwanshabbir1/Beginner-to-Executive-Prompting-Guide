Persona-based
 
value
 
propositions
 
acknowledge
 
the
 
diverse
 
priorities
 
of
 
different
 
stakeholders.
 
●
 
Stage-specific
 
activities
 
create
 
clear
 
guidance
 
on
 
the
 
next
 
steps.
 
●
 
The
 
objection
 
handling
 
guide
 
prepares
 
representatives
 
for
 
common
 
resistance
 
points.
