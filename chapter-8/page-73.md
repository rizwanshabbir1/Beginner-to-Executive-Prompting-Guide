Tips
 
for
 
Project
 
Management
 
&
 
Operations
 
Prompts
 
●
 
Specify
 
which
 
project
 
methodology
 
you're
 
using
 
(Agile,
 
Waterfall,
 
etc.)
 
●
 
Include
 
project
 
constraints
 
(timeline,
 
budget,
 
and
 
resources)
 
to
 
ensure
 
realistic
 
outputs.
 
●
 
Request
 
specific
 
tools
 
or
 
formats
 
that
 
align
 
with
 
your
 
organizational
 
standards.
 
●
 
For
 
process
 
documentation,
 
specify
 
the
 
level
 
of
 
detail
 
needed
 
(executive
 
vs.
 
implementer)
 
●
 
Include
 
industry-specific
 
requirements
 
or
 
compliance
 
considerations
 
●
 
Ask
 
for
 
visual
 
representations
 
(flowcharts,
 
diagrams)
 
for
 
complex
 
processes
 
●
 
For
 
metrics
 
and
 
KPIs,
 
clarify
 
calculation
 
methods
 
and
 
data
 
sources
 
●
 
Request
 
implementation
 
considerations
 
alongside
 
theoretical
 
frameworks
