Objection
 
Handling
 
Framework
 
Quick-Look
 
Definition:
 
Creating
 
structured
 
approaches
 
to
 
effectively
 
address
 
and
 
overcome
 
common
 
customer
 
concerns
 
or
 
resistance
 
points
 
during
 
the
 
sales
 
process.
 
Starter
 
Prompt:
 
How
 
should
 
we
 
respond
 
when
 
prospects
 
say
 
[COMMON
 
OBJECTION]
 
about
 
our
 
[PRODUCT/SER VICE]?
 
Executive
 
Prompt:
 
As
 
a
 
sales
 
methodology
 
expert
 
specializing
 
in
 
complex
 
sales,
 
I
 
will
 
create
 
a
 
comprehensive
 
framework
 
for
 
handling
 
objections
 
to
 
our
 
[PRODUCT/SER VICE].
 
First,
 
categorize
 
the
 
top
 
10
 
objections
 
by
 
type
 
(price,
 
competition,
 
timing,
 
etc.).
 
Then,
 
for
 
each
 
objection,
 
develop
 
1)
 
an
 
underlying
 
translation
 
of
 
what
 
the
 
prospect
 
is
 
saying,
 
2)
 
validation
 
questions
 
to
 
understand
 
better
 
their
 
specific
 
concern,
 
3)
 
a
 
reframing
 
approach
 
to
 
shifting
 
perspective,
 
4)
 
a
 
value-focused
 
response
 
with
 
supporting
 
evidence,
 
and
 
5)
 
suggested
 
next
 
step
 
to
 
move
 
the
 
conversation
 
forward—format
 
as
 
a
 
practical
 
guide
 
for
 
sales
 
conversations,
 
including
 
examples
 
of
 
effective
 
phrasing.
 
Why
 
It
 
Works:
 
●
 
The
 
sales
 
methodology
 
expert
 
role
 
brings
 
sophisticated
 
objection
 
response
 
patterns.
 
●
 
Categorization
 
organizes
 
responses
 
by
 
common
 
themes.
 
●
 
The
 
inclusion
 
of
 
validation
 
questions
 
prevents
 
premature
 
or
 
misaligned
 
responses.
 
●
 
The
 
next
 
step,
 
guidance,
 
bridges
 
from
 
objection
 
to
 
continued
 
progress.
 
Optional
 
Add-On:
 
"Include
 
specific
 
stories
 
or
 
case
 
studies
 
that
 
can
 
be
 
used
 
to
 
illustrate
 
points
 
compellingly ."
