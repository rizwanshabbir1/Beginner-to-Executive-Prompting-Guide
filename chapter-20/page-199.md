2.
 
Provide
 
context:
 
When
 
uploading
 
portions
 
of
 
a
 
larger
 
document,
 
briefly
 
explain
 
how
 
this
 
section
 
relates
 
to
 
the
 
overall
 
document.
 
3.
 
Use
 
sequential
 
analysis:
 
Upload
 
and
 
analyze
 
one
 
section
 
at
 
a
 
time,
 
building
 
on
 
insights
 
from
 
previous
 
sections.
 
Privacy
 
Considerations
 
1.
 
Redact
 
sensitive
 
information:
 
Remove
 
or
 
black
 
out
 
confidential
 
details
 
before
 
uploading
 
when
 
possible.
 
2.
 
Review
 
platform
 
policies:
 
Understand
 
how
 
each
 
AI
 
platform
 
handles
 
and
 
stores
 
the
 
documents
 
you
 
upload.
 
3.
 
Consider
 
alternatives:
 
For
 
highly
 
sensitive
 
materials,
 
consider
 
copying
 
only
 
relevant
 
non-sensitive
 
sections
 
rather
 
than
 
uploading
 
entire
 
documents.
 
Verification
 
is
 
Essential
 
1.
 
Cross-check
 
critical
 
information:
 
While
 
AI
 
is
 
powerful,
 
it
 
can
 
misinterpret
 
documents
 
or
 
make
 
mistakes.
 
2.
 
Request
 
citations:
 
Ask
 
the
 
AI
 
to
 
point
 
to
 
specific
 
pages
 
or
 
sections
 
when
 
providing
 
information.
 
3.
 
Verify
 
complex
 
calculations:
 
Double-check
 
financial
 
calculations
 
or
 
statistical
 
analyses
 
against
 
the
 
original
 
figures.
 
The
 
Future
 
of
 
Document
 
Interaction
 
As
 
RAG
 
technology
 
continues
 
to
 
evolve,
 
we
 
can
 
expect
 
more
 
sophisticated
 
document
 
interactions,
 
including:
 
1.
 
Multi-document
 
analysis:
 
Asking
 
questions
 
across
 
several
 
documents
 
simultaneously
 
2.
 
Visual
 
element
 
interpretation:
 
Better
 
understanding
 
of
 
charts,
 
graphs,
 
and
 
images
 
within
 
documents
 
3.
 
Temporal
 
awareness:
 
Understanding
 
date-dependent
 
information
 
and
 
tracking
 
changes
 
across
 
document
 
versions
 
4.
 
More
 
specialized
 
document
 
handling:
 
Improved
 
capabilities
 
for
 
industry-specific
 
documents
 
like
 
medical
 
records
 
or
 
technical
 
specifications
