Best
 
Practices
 
and
 
Tips
 
Document
 
Preparation
 
1.
 
Ensure
 
clarity:
 
Upload
 
documents
 
with
 
clear
 
text—scanned
 
documents
 
should
 
be
 
thoroughly
 
checked
 
for
 
optical
 
character
 
recognition
 
(OCR)
 
accuracy .
 
2.
 
Check
 
formatting:
 
Well-structured
 
documents,
 
complete
 
with
 
headings,
 
paragraphs,
 
and
 
tables,
 
are
 
easier
 
for
 
AI
 
to
 
interpret.
 
3.
 
Consider
 
the
 
following
 
resolution:
 
For
 
documents
 
with
 
charts
 
or
 
images,
 
higher-resolution
 
uploads
 
preserve
 
essential
 
visual
 
information.
 
Handling
 
Large
 
Documents
 
1.
 
Chunk
 
strategically:
 
If
 
your
 
document
 
exceeds
 
upload
 
limits,
 
divide
 
it
 
logically
 
(by
 
chapters,
 
sections,
 
or
 
periods)
 
to
 
ensure
 
efficient
 
uploading.
