A
 
Beginner's
 
Guide
 
to
 
Retrieval-Augmented
 
Generation
 
(RAG)
 
 
Introduction
 
to
 
RAG
 
Imagine
 
having
 
a
 
conversation
 
with
 
your
 
documents—asking
 
questions
 
about
 
your
 
tax
 
return,
 
inquiring
 
about
 
specific
 
details
 
in
 
a
 
research
 
paper ,
 
or
 
finding
 
relevant
 
sections
 
in
 
a
 
lengthy
 
contract
 
without
 
the
 
need
 
for
 
endless
 
scrolling.
 
This
 
is
 
no
 
longer
 
science
 
fiction,
 
thanks
 
to
 
Retrieval-Augmented
 
Generation
 
(RAG).
 
RAG
 
represents
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
most
 
practical
 
applications
 
of
 
modern
 
AI,
 
combining
 
the
 
power
 
of
 
large
 
language
 
models
 
with
 
the
 
ability
 
to
 
reference
 
specific
 
information
 
from
 
your
 
documents.
 
Unlike
 
traditional
 
AI
 
interactions
 
where
 
the
 
model
 
can
 
only
 
draw
 
from
 
its
 
general
 
training
 
knowledge,
 
RAG
 
enables
 
AI
 
systems
 
to
 
"read"
 
your
 
uploaded
 
files
 
and
 
respond
 
based
 
on
 
their
 
contents.
 
The
 
concept
 
is
 
straightforward:
 
you
 
upload
 
a
 
document,
 
and
 
then
 
you
 
can
 
ask
 
questions
 
about
 
it
 
in
 
plain
 
language.
 
The
 
AI
 
retrieves
 
relevant
 
information
 
from
 
your
 
document
 
and
 
generates
 
responses
 
that
 
directly
 
address
 
your
 
queries.
 
This
 
marriage
 
of
 
retrieval
 
(finding
 
relevant
 
information)
 
and
 
generation
 
(creating
 
coherent
 
responses)
 
is
 
what
 
makes
 
RAG
 
so
 
powerful
 
for
 
everyday
 
use.
