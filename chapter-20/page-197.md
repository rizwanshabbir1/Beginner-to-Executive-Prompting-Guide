to
 
structure
 
its

in
 
a
 
way
 
that's
 
most

Analysis
 
Ask
 
the
 
AI
 
to
 
compare
 
or
 
contrast
 
information
 
within
 
your
 
document:
 
"In
 
the

handbook,
 
compare
 
the
 
benefits
 
packages
 
offered
 
for
 
full-time

Let's
 
explore
 
real-world
 
applications
 
of

three
 
revenue
 
drivers
 
this
 
quarter?"
 
●
 
"Identify
 
any
 
expenses
 
that
 
increased
 
by
 
more
 
than
 
15%
 
compared
 
to
 
last
 
quarter
 
and
 
explain
 
potential
 
reasons
 
based
 
on
 
the

section."
 
●
 
"Create
 
a

The
 
AI
 
will

for
 
relevant
 
financial

extract
 
the
 
specific
