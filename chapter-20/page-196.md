Effective
 
Prompting
 
Techniques
 
The
 
way
 
you
 
pose
 
questions
 
to
 
AI
 
about
 
your
 
documents
 
significantly
 
impacts
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
responses.
 
Here
 
are
 
some
 
techniques
 
to
 
get
 
the
 
most
 
out
 
of
 
RAG:
 
Be
 
Specific
 
and
 
Contextual
 
Less
 
effective:
 
"Tell
 
me
 
about
 
the
 
document."
 
More
 
effective:
 
"Based
 
on
 
the
 
uploaded
 
financial
 
statement,
 
what
 
was
 
the
 
company's
 
net
 
profit
 
margin
 
in
 
Q2
 
2024,
 
and
 
how
 
does
 
it
 
compare
 
to
 
Q1?"
 
Use
 
Step-by-Step
 
Questioning
 
Rather
 
than
 
asking
 
complex
 
multi-part
 
questions,
 
break
 
them
 
down
 
into
 
a
 
sequence:

"What
 
are
 
the
 
main
 
sections
 
in
 
this
 
research
 
paper?"
