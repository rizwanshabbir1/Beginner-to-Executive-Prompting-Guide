Your
 
goal
 
is
 
to
 
evaluate
 
a
 
new
 
fitness
 
application
 
launch

this
 
context:
 
a
 
competitive
 
landscape
 
with
 
many
 
established
 
options
 
Format
 
your
 
response
 
as
 
a
 
bulleted
 
list
 
of
 
three
 
differentiation
 
approaches
 
Use
 
a
 
professional
 
yet
 
accessible
 
communication
 
style
 
 
Another
 
prompt
 
example:
 
"You
 
are
 
a
 
senior
 
business
 
analyst
 
helping
 
me
 
create
 
a
 
project
 
summary .
 
I
 
need
 
a
 
2-page
 
executive
 
summary
 
for
 
a
 
client
 
presentation
 
about
 
our
 
database
 
migration
 
project.
 
The
 
audience
 
consists
 
of
 
C-level
 
executives
 
who
 
prioritize
 
business
 
impact
 
over
 
technical
 
details.
 
Focus
 
on
 
the
 
benefits
 
achieved,
 
timeline,
 
and
 
return
 
on
 
investment
 
(ROI).
 
Use
 
professional
 
language
 
and
 
include
 
clear
 
recommendations
 
for

Using
 
Examples
 
in
 
Prompts:
 
Providing
 
examples
 
of
 
input
 
and
 
output
 
content
 
and
 
format
 
is
 
helpful
 
for
 
the
 
model,
 
especially
 
when
 
the
 
model
 
may
 
lack
 
training
 
on
 
your
 
request
 
or
 
use
 
case.
 
Helping
 
the
 
model
 
with
 
examples
 
is
 
also
 
known
 
as
 
few-shot
 
Prompting.
 
Choose
 
examples
 
that
 
are
 
relevant,
 
high-quality ,
 
and
 
written.
 
Even
 
minor
 
errors
 
can
 
mislead
 
the
 
model.
 
To
 
build
 
robust
 
outputs,
 
include
 
diverse
 
casesâ€”especially
 
instances
 
of
 
edge
 
(inputs
 
that
 
are
 
unusual
 
or
 
unexpected)
 
the
 
model
 
should
 
learn
 
to
 
handle.
