interview
 
you,
 
gather
 
your
 
preferences,
 
and
 
even
 
draft
 
a
 
better
 
prompt—along
 
with
 
an
 
explanation
 
of
 
why
 
it's
 
an
 
improvement.
 
Ultimately ,
 
you
 
have
 
the

●
 
Prompts
 
are
 
generally
 
not
 
portable
 
across
 
different
 
AI

What

strategy
 
is

●
 
Favor
 
shorter ,
 
concise
 
sentences
 
with

Be

about

Pro
 
Tips
 
for
 
Effective
 
Prompting
 
●
 
Be
 
specific
 
about
 
your
 
expectations
 
and
 
desired
 
output
 
format
 
●
 
Include
 
relevant
 
context
 
or
 
background
 
information
 
●
 
Specify
 
the
 
role
 
you
 
want
 
the
 
AI
 
to
 
assume
 
●
 
Break
 
complex
 
requests
 
into
 
sequential
 
prompts
 
(also
 
known
 
as
 
multi-step
 
workflows
 
where
 
you
 
use
 
sequential
 
Prompting,
 
iterative
 
refinement,
 
or
 
task
 
decomposition
 
to
 
get
 
better
 
results)
 
●
 
Request
 
explanations
 
of
 
reasoning
 
for
 
analytical
 
tasks
 
●
 
Use
 
clear ,
 
unambiguous
 
language
 
●
 
Iterate
 
and
 
refine
 
based
 
on
 
initial
 
responses
