versions
 
for
 
a
 
new
 
eco-friendly
 
water

Why
 
It
 
Works:
 
●
 
Sets
 
a
 
clear
 
role
 
and
 
final
 
format
 
(a
 
table
 
with
 
specific
 
columns),
 
providing
 
the
 
AI
 
with
 
structure
 
and
 
keeping
 
responses
 
concise
 
and
 
on-target.
 
●
 
Break
 
the
 
task
 
into
 
parts
 
(hook,
 
proposition,
 
CTA),
 
guiding
 
the
 
model
 
to
 
address
 
each
 
element
 
of
 
compelling
 
ad
 
copy
 
step
 
by
 
step.
 
Optional
 
Add-On:
 
Append
 
"Include
 
an
 
emoji
 
in
 
each
 
ad
 
copy
 
if
 
appropriate."
 
for
 
extra
 
personality .
