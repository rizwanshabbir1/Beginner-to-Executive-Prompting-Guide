Chapter
 
3:
 
Marketing
 
&
 
Communications
 
 
 
Marketing
 
and
 
communications
 
professionals
 
operate
 
in
 
a
 
fast-paced
 
environment
 
where
 
content
 
creation,
 
audience
 
analysis,
 
and
 
campaign
 
planning
 
require
 
both
 
creativity
 
and
 
analytical
 
rigor.
 
AI
 
prompting
 
can
 
dramatically
 
accelerate
 
these
 
workflows
 
by
 
generating
 
initial
 
drafts,
 
uncovering
 
competitive
 
insights,
 
and
 
structuring
 
strategic
 
approaches
 
to
 
brand
 
communications.
 
Effective
 
Prompting
 
for
 
marketing
 
contexts
 
requires
 
balancing
 
creative
 
latitude
 
with
 
brand
 
consistency ,
 
audience
 
specificity
 
with
 
broad
 
appeal,
 
and
 
strategic
 
vision
 
with
 
tactical
 
execution.
 
The
 
prompts
 
in
 
this
 
chapter
 
are
 
designed
 
to
 
serve
 
marketers
 
across
 
the
 
spectrum—from
 
content
 
creators
 
and
 
social
 
media
 
managers
 
to
 
CMOs
 
and
 
brand
 
strategists—by
 
providing
 
frameworks
 
that
 
generate
 
high-quality
 
outputs
 
while
 
maintaining
 
the
 
marketer's
 
strategic
 
control
 
and
 
creative
 
direction.
