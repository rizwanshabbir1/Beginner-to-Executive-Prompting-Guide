Creating
 
a
 
structured
 
methodology
 
for
 
evaluating
 
complex
 
strategic
 
decisions
 
with
 
multiple
 
variables,
 
stakeholders,
 
and
 
potential
 
outcomes.
 
Starter
 
Prompt:
 
How
 
should
 
I
 
decide
 
whether
 
to
 
[STRA TEGIC
 
OPTION]?
 
What
 
factors
 
should
 
I
 
consider?
 
Executive
 
Prompt:
 
As
 
a
 
decision
 
science
 
specialist
 
with
 
C-suite
 
advisory
 
experience,
 
create
 
a
 
decision
 
framework
 
for
 
evaluating
 
whether
 
to
 
[STRA TEGIC
 
OPTION].
 
 
 
First,
 
identify
 
the
 
five
 
most
 
critical
 
decision
 
criteria,
 
with
 
a
 
rationale
 
for
 
each.
 
 
 
Then,
 
develop
 
a
 
weighted
 
scoring
 
matrix
 
for
 
evaluating
 
alternatives
 
against
 
these
 
criteria.
 
 
 
Next,
 
outline
 
the
 
three
 
most
 
viable
 
options
 
(including
 
the
 
status
 
quo)
 
and
 
assess
 
each
 
against
 
your
 
framework.
 
 
 
Finally ,
 
recommend
 
a
 
structured
 
process
 
for
 
making
 
this
 
decision,
 
including:
 
 
1)
 
key
 
stakeholders
 
to
 
involve,
 
 
2)
 
critical
 
data
 
to
 
gather ,
 
 
3)
 
potential
 
cognitive
 
biases
 
to
 
mitigate,
 
and
 
 
4)
 
implementation
 
considerations.
