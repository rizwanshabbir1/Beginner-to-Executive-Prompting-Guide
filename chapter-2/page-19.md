Today ,
 
prompts
 
are
 
powerful
 
tools
 
for
 
generating
 
presentations,
 
study
 
materials,
 
business
 
documents,
 
and
 
more.
 
Take
 
NotebookLM
,
 
for
 
example.
 
With
 
the
 
right
 
prompts,
 
it
 
can
 
create
 
everything
 
from
 
summaries
 
and
 
FAQs
 
to
 
structured
 
study
 
guides
 
and
 
even
 
mind
 
maps.
 
Whether
 
you're
 
a
 
student,
 
researcher ,
 
or
 
executive,
 
prompts
 
are
 
now
 
essential
 
for
 
transforming
 
raw
 
information
 
into
 
clear ,
 
actionable
 
insights.
 
 
This
 
Guide
 
focuses
 
primarily
 
on
 
generating
 
text-based
 
outputs
 
using
 
large
 
language
 
models.
 
As
 
of
 
2025,
 
these
 
models
 
can
 
also
 
analyze
 
attached
 
photos
 
or
 
screenshots
 
and
 
provide
 
relevant
 
answers
 
or
 
insights.
 
Additionally ,
 
they
 
are
 
capable
 
of
 
generating
 
business
 
artifacts
 
such
 
as
 
visual
 
illustrations,
 
wireframes,
 
and
 
mind
 
maps.
 
However ,
 
creating
 
images
 
or
 
videos
 
from
 
natural
 
language
 
prompts
 
involves
 
a
 
different
 
class
 
of
 
models—text-to-image
 
and
 
text-to-video—which
 
will
 
be
 
covered
 
in
 
a
 
separate
 
guide.
