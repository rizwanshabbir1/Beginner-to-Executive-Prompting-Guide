Prompt
 
engineering
 
is
 
the
 
art
 
and
 
science
 
of
 
crafting
 
adequate
 
instructions
 
for
 
AI
 
systems.
 
Unlike
 
traditional
 
programming,
 
which
 
employs
 
strict
 
syntax
 
and
 
logic,
 
prompt
 
engineering
 
necessitates
 
understanding
 
how
 
to
 
frame
 
questions
 
and
 
tasks
 
in
 
a
 
manner
 
that
 
AI
 
models
 
can
 
interpret
 
accurately .
 
This
 
foundational
 
chapter
 
covers
 
the
 
essential
 
principles
 
and
 
structures
 
that
 
make
 
prompts
 
effective
 
across
 
all
 
contexts
 
and
 
applications.
 
 
“Those
 
who
 
know
 
how
 
to
 
prompt
 
the
 
AI
 
to
 
do
 
their
 
bidding,
 
and
 
to
 
do
 
it
 
faster
 
and
 
better
 
and
 
more
 
creatively
 
than
 
anyone
 
else,
 
are
 
going
 
to
 
be
 
golden."

The
 
ability
 
to
 
craft
 
precise
 
prompts
 
is
 
becoming
 
increasingly
 
valuable
 
across
 
professions,
 
regardless
 
of
 
technical
 
background.
 
Whether
 
you're
 
a
 
marketing
 
professional
 
drafting
 
content,
 
an
 
executive
 
preparing
 
a
 
strategy
 
document,
 
or
 
a
 
developer
 
debugging
 
code,
 
understanding
 
how
 
to
 
communicate
 
effectively
 
with
 
AI
 
systems
 
can
 
significantly
 
improve
 
your
 
outputs
 
and
 
efficiency .
 
ChatGPT’ s
 
interface
 
helped
 
bring
 
prompts
 
into
 
the
 
spotlight
 
—
 
but
 
they’ve
 
evolved
 
far
 
beyond
 
just
 
chatbots.
