On
 
a
 
whim,
 
she
 
opens
 
a
 
tab
 
to
 
something
 
called
 
"ChatGPT ,"
 
which
 
her
 
tech-savvy
 
nephew
 
mentioned
 
over
 
the
 
weekend.
 
She
 
types:
 
"Help
 
me
 
write
 
a
 
proposal
 
for
 
digital
 
transformation
 
consulting
 
services
 
for
 
a
 
manufacturing
 
company ."
 
What
 
happens
 
next
 
changes
 
everything.
 
In
 
seconds,
 
paragraphs
 
of
 
coherent,
 
professional
 
text
 
appear
 
on
 
her
 
screen.
 
Not
 
just
 
generic
 
filler
 
but
 
thoughtful
 
analysis
 
of
 
manufacturing
 
challenges,
 
strategic
 
recommendations,
 
and
 
compelling
 
value
 
propositions.
 
Sarah
 
stares
 
in
 
disbelief,
 
then
 
starts
 
refining
 
and
 
personalizing
 
the
 
content.
 
Two
 
hours
 
later,
 
she
 
submits
 
what
 
becomes
 
the
 
most
 
successful
 
proposal
 
of
 
her
 
career .
 
This
 
is
 
the
 
moment
 
Sarah
 
realizes
 
she's
 
living
 
through
 
the
 
most
 
significant
 
technological
 
shift
 
since
 
the
 
advent
 
of
 
the
 
internet.
 
What
 
Exactly
 
Is
 
This
 
"AI"
 
Everyone's
 
Talking
 
About?
 
Artificial
 
Intelligence
 
may
 
sound
 
like
 
science
 
fiction,
 
but
 
it
 
has
 
been
 
quietly
 
powering
 
our
 
lives
 
for
 
years.
 
Every
 
time
 
Netflix
 
recommends
 
the
 
perfect
 
show
 
when
 
your
 
phone's
 
camera
 
recognizes
 
faces
 
or
 
when
 
spam
 
emails
 
get
 
filtered
 
out
 
automatically—that's
 
AI
 
at
 
work.
 
But
 
what
 
changed
 
everything
 
in
 
2022
 
was
 
the
 
arrival
 
of
 
Large
 
Language
 
Models
 
(LLMs)
—AI
 
systems
 
that
 
can
 
understand
 
and
 
generate
 
human
 
language
 
with
 
unprecedented
 
sophistication.
 
Think
 
of
 
them
 
as
 
incredibly
 
well-read
 
assistants
 
who've
 
absorbed
 
virtually
 
all
 
of
 
human
 
knowledge
 
and
 
can
 
now
 
have
 
conversations,
 
write
 
documents,
 
solve
 
problems,
 
and
 
think
 
through
 
complex
 
challenges.
 
These
 
aren't
 
just
 
clever
 
search
 
engines.
 
They're
 
thinking
 
machines
 
that
 
can:
 
●
 
Understand
 
context
 
and
 
nuance
 
in
 
ways
 
that
 
previous
 
technology
 
never
 
could
 
●
 
Generate
 
original
 
content
 
that
 
feels
 
genuinely
 
human-authored
 
●
 
Reason
 
through
 
problems
 
step
 
by
 
step,
 
just
 
like
 
a
 
human
 
colleague
 
●
 
Adapt
 
their
 
communication
 
style
 
to
 
match
 
your
 
needs
 
and
 
preferences
 
●
 
Learn
 
from
 
your
 
feedback
 
within
 
conversations
 
to
 
improve
 
their
 
responses
 
The
 
Three
 
Waves
 
of
 
AI
 
To
 
understand
 
where
 
we
 
are
 
today ,
 
it
 
helps
 
to
 
see
 
how
 
we
 
got
 
here:
 
Wave
 
1:
 
Narrow
 
AI
 
(1950s-2010s)
 
Early
 
AI
 
could
 
beat
 
humans
 
at
 
specific
 
tasks—such
 
as
 
playing
 
chess,
 
recognizing
 
images,
 
and
 
translating
 
text—but
 
only
 
one
 
thing
 
at
 
a
 
time.
