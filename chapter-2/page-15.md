Role-Specific
 
Guidance:
 
Instead
 
of
 
generic
 
advice,
 
you'll
 
find
 
specialized
 
approaches
 
for
 
your
 
specific
 
function—whether
 
you're
 
in
 
HR,
 
finance,
 
marketing,
 
operations,
 
or
 
leadership.
 
From
 
Beginner
 
to
 
Expert:
 
We
 
begin
 
with
 
simple
 
"starter
 
prompts"
 
that
 
anyone
 
can
 
use
 
immediately ,
 
then
 
progress
 
to
 
sophisticated
 
"executive
 
prompts"
 
that
 
unlock
 
the
 
full
 
potential
 
of
 
AI.
 
Business-focused:
 
Every
 
example
 
and
 
framework
 
connects
 
directly
 
to
 
business
 
outcomes—increased
 
efficiency ,
 
better
 
decisions,
 
and
 
improved
 
results.
 
The
 
Prompt
 
Engineering
 
Advantage
 
At
 
the
 
heart
 
of
 
AI
 
fluency
 
is
 
a
 
skill
 
called
 
prompt
 
engineering
—the
 
art
 
and
 
science
 
of
 
crafting
 
adequate
 
instructions
 
for
 
AI
 
systems.
 
Unlike
 
traditional
 
programming,
 
which
 
employs
 
strict
 
syntax
 
and
 
logic,
 
prompt
 
engineering
 
necessitates
 
understanding
 
how
 
to
 
frame
 
questions
 
and
 
tasks
 
in
 
a
 
manner
 
that
 
AI
 
models
 
can
 
interpret
 
accurately .
 
Modern
 
AI
 
can
 
generate
 
virtually
 
any
 
type
 
of
 
content—stunning
 
images
 
from
 
text
 
descriptions,
 
original
 
music
 
compositions,
 
realistic
 
videos,
 
computer
 
code,
 
and
 
much
 
more.
 
However ,
 
this
 
Guide
 
focuses
 
specifically
 
on
 
text-based
 
Prompting
—using
 
written
 
instructions
 
to
 
generate
 
written
 
responses,
 
analysis,
 
and
 
solutions.
 
Why
 
focus
 
on
 
text?
 
Because
 
text-based
 
AI
 
interactions
 
form
 
the
 
foundation
 
of
 
business
 
productivity .
 
Whether
 
you're
 
drafting
 
emails,
 
analyzing
 
data,
 
creating
 
reports,
 
or
 
developing
 
strategies,
 
the
 
ability
 
to
 
communicate
 
effectively
 
with
 
AI
 
through
 
written
 
prompts
 
is
 
your
 
gateway
 
to
 
dramatically
 
enhanced
 
professional
 
capabilities.
 
Think
 
of
 
it
 
like
 
learning
 
a
 
new
 
language,
 
except
 
this
 
language
 
has
 
the
 
power
 
to:
 
●
 
Turn
 
your
 
rough
 
ideas
 
into
 
polished
 
presentations
 
●
 
Transform
 
complex
 
data
 
into
 
clear
 
insights
 
●
 
Convert
 
your
 
expertise
 
into
 
scalable
 
solutions
 
●
 
Bridge
 
the
 
gap
 
between
 
what
 
you
 
know
 
and
 
what
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
accomplish
 
Your
 
Competitive
 
Edge
 
Awaits
 
The
 
professionals
 
who
 
master
 
prompt
 
engineering
 
aren't
 
just
 
keeping
 
up
 
with
 
the
 
AI
 
revolution—they're
 
leading
 
it.
 
They're
 
the
 
ones
 
getting
 
promoted,
 
winning
 
new
 
business,
 
and
 
driving
 
innovation
 
in
 
their
 
organizations.
