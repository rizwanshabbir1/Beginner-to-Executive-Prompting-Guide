It's
 
like
 
having
 
a
 
brilliant
 
colleague
 
who's
 
a
 
chess
 
grandmaster
 
but
 
struggles
 
to
 
tie
 
their
 
shoes.
 
Wave
 
2:
 
The
 
Internet
 
Era
 
(1990s-2020s)
 
Search
 
engines
 
and
 
algorithms
 
began
 
connecting
 
information
 
and
 
making
 
predictions.
 
Google
 
could
 
find
 
anything,
 
and
 
Amazon
 
could
 
recommend
 
products,
 
but
 
they
 
were
 
still
 
just
 
sophisticated
 
information
 
retrievers.
 
Wave
 
3:
 
Generative
 
AI
 
(2020s-Present)
 
Now
 
we
 
have
 
AI
 
that
 
can
 
create,
 
reason,
 
and
 
converse.
 
It's
 
like
 
having
 
a
 
research
 
assistant,
 
creative
 
partner ,
 
and
 
strategic
 
advisor
 
all
 
rolled
 
into
 
one—available
 
24/7,
 
never
 
tired,
 
and
 
infinitely
 
patient.
 
Why
 
Language
 
Models
 
Are
 
Different
 
Here's
 
what
 
makes
 
Large
 
Language
 
Models
 
revolutionary:
 
they
 
understand
 
that
 
language
 
isn't
 
just
 
about
 
words—it's
 
about
 
meaning,
 
context,
 
and
 
intention
.
 
When
 
you
 
tell
 
a
 
traditional
 
computer
 
program,
 
"Schedule
 
a
 
meeting
 
with
 
the
 
team,"
 
it
 
doesn't
 
know
 
what
 
you
 
mean.
 
But
 
when
 
you
 
tell
 
an
 
LLM
 
the
 
same
 
thing,
 
it
 
understands
 
you're
 
asking
 
it
 
to:
 
●
 
Figure
 
out
 
who's
 
on
 
"the
 
team."
 
●
 
Find
 
a
 
time
 
that
 
works
 
for
 
everyone
 
●
 
Send
 
appropriate
 
invitations
 
●
 
Maybe
 
even
 
suggest
 
an
 
agenda
 
This
 
shift
 
from
 
following
 
rigid
 
instructions
 
to
 
understanding
 
human
 
intent
 
is
 
what
 
makes
 
LLMs
 
feel
 
almost
 
magical
 
to
 
use.
 
The
 
Business
 
Impact:
 
Not
 
Just
 
Hype
 
While
 
tech
 
headlines
 
often
 
focus
 
on
 
dramatic
 
predictions
 
about
 
AI
 
replacing
 
jobs
 
or
 
achieving
 
consciousness,
 
the
 
real
 
story
 
is
 
more
 
nuanced
 
and
 
immediately
 
practical.
 
Right
 
now,
 
today,
 
AI
 
is
 
helping
 
professionals:
 
●
 
Cut
 
writing
 
time
 
by
 
60-80%
 
while
 
improving
 
quality
 
●
 
Analyze
 
data
 
patterns
 
that
 
would
 
take
 
humans
 
weeks
 
to
 
identify
 
●
 
Generate
 
creative
 
concepts
 
for
 
marketing
 
campaigns
 
and
 
product
 
development
 
●
 
Automate
 
routine
 
tasks
 
so
 
teams
 
can
 
focus
 
on
 
strategic
 
work
 
●
 
Translate
 
complex
 
technical
 
information
 
into
 
accessible
 
business
 
language
