The
 
Art
 
&
 
Science
 
of
 
Crafting
 
Effective
 
Prompts
 
Successful
 
AI
 
instructions
 
provide
 
clarity ,
 
background
 
information,
 
and
 
specific
 
guidance.
 
Unlike
 
general
 
questions,
 
well-formed
 
instructions
 
include:
 
●
 
Clear
 
objective
:
 
What
 
specific
 
result
 
are
 
you
 
seeking?
 
 
●
 
Background
 
information
:
 
Relevant
 
context
 
the
 
AI
 
should
 
consider
 
●
 
Structure
 
preferences
:
 
How
 
should
 
the
 
response
 
be
 
organized?
 
●
 
Stylistic
 
guidance
:
 
What
 
voice
 
or
 
approach
 
should
 
the
 
AI
 
adopt?
 
●
 
Output
 
structure
:
 
What
 
output
 
instructions
 
or
 
constraints
 
should
 
it
 
follow?
 
 
Use
 
simple
 
words
 
and
 
avoid
 
ambiguity
 
and
 
complexity .
 
Favor
 
clarity
 
over
 
brevity .
 
For
 
instance,
 
spell
 
out
 
abbreviations.
 
Remember ,
 
AI
 
is
 
more
 
than
 
just
 
a
 
tool—it’ s
 
a
 
thought
 
partner
 
and
 
assistant
 
with
 
access
 
to
 
vast
 
knowledge
 
and
 
data.
 
Use
 
it
 
iteratively ,
 
challenge
 
its
 
responses,
 
and
 
learn
 
how
 
to
 
harness
 
it
 
effectively .
 
 
Basic
 
Structure
 
A
 
fundamental
 
instruction
 
structure
 
follows
 
this
 
pattern
 
(replace
 
the
 
text
 
in
 
square
 
brackets
 
with
 
your
 
own):
 
Assume
 
the
 
role
 
of
 
[expertise
 
area]
 
Your
 
goal
 
is
 
to
 
[specific
 
action]
 
Consider
 
this
 
context:
 
[relevant
 
information]
 
Format
 
your
 
response
 
as
 
[desired
 
structure]
 
Use
 
a
 
[specific]
 
communication
 
style
 
 
Here
 
are
 
two
 
sample
 
prompts
 
to
 
help
 
you
 
get
 
started.
 
 
Example
 
of
 
a
 
basic
 
prompt:
 
Assume
 
the
 
role
 
of
 
an
 
experienced
 
market
 
analyst
