The
 
Great
 
Divide:
 
AI
 
Natives
 
vs.
 
AI
 
Hesitant
 
In
 
boardrooms
 
and
 
break
 
rooms
 
across
 
the
 
globe,
 
professionals
 
are
 
falling
 
into
 
two
 
camps:
 
AI
 
Natives:
 
Those
 
who've
 
embraced
 
AI
 
tools
 
and
 
developed
 
fluency
 
in
 
working
 
with
 
them.
 
They're
 
experiencing
 
unprecedented
 
productivity
 
gains
 
and
 
creative
 
breakthroughs.
 
AI
 
Hesitant:
 
Those
 
who
 
are
 
waiting
 
for
 
the
 
"dust
 
to
 
settle"
 
or
 
worried
 
about
 
potential
 
risks.
 
They're
 
watching
 
from
 
the
 
sidelines
 
as
 
their
 
AI-native
 
colleagues
 
pull
 
ahead.
 
The
 
gap
 
between
 
these
 
groups
 
is
 
widening
 
rapidly .
 
The
 
professionals
 
who
 
learn
 
to
 
collaborate
 
with
 
AI
 
effectively
 
aren't
 
just
 
getting
 
incrementally
 
better
 
results—they're
 
operating
 
at
 
a
 
completely
 
different
 
level.
