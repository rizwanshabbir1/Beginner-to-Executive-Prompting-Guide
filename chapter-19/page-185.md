Building
 
Your
 
Interview
 
Assistant
 
Create
 
a
 
customized
 
AI
 
coaching
 
experience
 
by
 
establishing
 
persistent
 
context
 
and
 
preferences:
 
Profile
 
Development:
 
Provide
 
AI
 
with
 
your
 
resume,
 
target
 
roles,
 
and
 
key
 
experiences
 
to
 
create
 
personalized
 
coaching
 
that
 
builds
 
upon
 
your
 
actual
 
background
 
rather
 
than
 
generic
 
advice.
 
Progress
 
Tracking:
 
Document
 
your
 
areas
 
for
 
improvement
 
and
 
track
 
progress
 
over
 
multiple
 
practice
 
sessions.
 
This
 
longitudinal
 
approach
 
enables
 
more
 
sophisticated
 
coaching
 
that
 
addresses
 
your
 
specific
 
development
 
needs.
 
Question
 
Libraries:
 
Build
 
databases
 
of
 
questions
 
specific
 
to
 
your
 
industry ,
 
role
 
level,
 
and
 
career
 
goals.
 
This
 
specialized
 
collection
 
becomes
 
more
 
valuable
 
as
 
you
 
advance
 
in
 
your
 
career
 
and
 
face
 
increasingly
 
sophisticated
 
interview
 
processes.
 
Managing
 
Authenticity
 
and
 
AI
 
Assistance
 
The
 
goal
 
of
 
AI-powered
 
interview
 
preparation
 
is
 
to
 
enhance
 
your
 
natural
 
abilities,
 
not
 
replace
 
your
 
personality
 
with
 
artificial
 
responses.
 
Maintaining
 
authenticity
 
while
 
leveraging
 
AI
 
assistance
 
requires
 
thoughtful
 
balance
 
and
 
a
 
strategic
 
approach.
 
Using
 
AI
 
as
 
Enhancement,
 
Not
 
Replacement
 
Content
 
Foundation:
 
Use
 
AI
 
to
 
structure
 
your
 
genuine
 
experiences
 
and
 
perspectives
 
rather
 
than
 
generating
 
fictional
 
examples
 
or
 
responses.
 
Your
 
authentic
 
stories
 
and
 
motivations
 
provide
 
the
 
raw
 
material;
 
AI
 
helps
 
organize
 
and
 
present
 
them
 
effectively .
 
Personal
 
Voice:
 
Tailor
 
AI
 
suggestions
 
to
 
align
 
with
 
your
 
natural
 
communication
 
style.
 
Formal
 
AI
 
language
 
might
 
not
 
suit
 
your
 
personality
 
or
 
the
 
company
 
culture.
 
Modify
 
responses
 
to
 
sound
 
like
 
you
 
while
 
retaining
 
structural
 
improvements.
 
Genuine
 
Preparation:
 
Focus
 
on
 
understanding
 
rather
 
than
 
memorization.
 
AI
 
helps
 
you
 
think
 
through
 
potential
 
questions
 
and
 
develop
 
talking
 
points.
 
Still,
 
your
 
actual
 
interview
 
responses
 
should
 
flow
 
naturally
 
from
 
this
 
preparation
 
rather
 
than
 
being
 
scripted.
