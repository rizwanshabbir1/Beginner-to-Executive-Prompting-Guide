Picture
 
this:
 
It's
 
a
 
Tuesday
 
morning
 
in
 
late
 
2022.
 
Sarah,
 
a
 
marketing
 
director
 
at
 
a
 
mid-sized
 
consulting
 
firm,
 
sits
 
at
 
her
 
desk
 
staring
 
at
 
a
 
blank
 
document.
 
She
 
needs
 
to
 
write
 
a
 
compelling
 
proposal
 
for
 
a
 
new
 
clientâ€”one
 
that
 
could
 
make
 
or
 
break
 
her
 
quarter .
 
The
 
deadline
 
is
 
in
 
two
 
hours,
 
and
 
she's
 
battling
 
writer's
 
block.
