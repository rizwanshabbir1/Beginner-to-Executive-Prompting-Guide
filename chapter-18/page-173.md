Transform
 
your
 
experiences
 
into
 
compelling
 
narratives
 
using
 
the
 
Situation,
 
Task,
 
Action,
 
and
 
Result
 
framework.
 
This
 
step
 
bridges
 
the
 
gap
 
between
 
your
 
background
 
and
 
interview
 
requirements
 
by
 
structuring
 
your
 
experiences
 
to
 
maximize
 
their
 
impact.
 
Objective:
 
Create
 
4-6
 
polished
 
stories
 
that
 
demonstrate
 
key
 
competencies
 
and
 
can
 
be
 
adapted
 
to
 
various
 
questions.
 
Sample
 
Prompt:
 
I
 
want
 
to
 
answer
 
the
 
question,
 
"Describe
 
a
 
time
 
you
 
faced
 
a
 
major
 
challenge
 
and
 
how
 
you
 
overcame
 
it,"
 
using
 
the
 
STAR
 
method.
 
 
 
Situation/T ask:
 
In
 
my
 
senior
 
year,
 
I
 
led
 
a
 
team
 
project
 
that
 
fell
 
behind
 
schedule
 
when
 
two
 
members
 
quit.
 
We
 
had
 
two
 
weeks
 
left
 
to
 
deliver
 
a
 
research
 
report.
 
 
 
Action:
 
I
 
organized
 
daily
 
check-ins,
 
redistributed
 
tasks
 
among
 
remaining
 
members,
 
and
 
personally
 
took
 
on
 
extra
 
data
 
analysis.
 
I
 
also
 
communicated
 
honestly
 
with
 
our
 
professor
 
to
 
manage
 
expectations.
 
 
 
Result:
 
We
 
not
 
only
 
finished
 
on
 
time
 
but
 
scored
 
90%,
 
and
 
I
 
learned
 
how
 
to
 
motivate
 
a
 
team
 
under
 
pressure.
 
 
 
Now,
 
draft
 
this
 
into
 
a
 
well-structured
 
STAR
 
answer
 
I
 
can
 
deliver
 
in
 
about
 
2
 
minutes.
 
The
 
AI
 
will
 
structure
 
your
 
raw
 
experience
 
into
 
a
 
cohesive
 
narrative
 
with
 
smooth
 
transitions,
 
a
 
clear
 
demonstration
 
of
 
skills,
 
and
 
compelling
 
results.
 
The
 
polished
 
version
 
should
 
sound
 
natural
 
while
 
hitting
 
all
 
key
 
elements
 
of
 
persuasive
 
storytelling.
