Mock
 
Interviews
 
Practice
 
your
 
responses
 
in
 
an
 
interactive
 
format
 
that
 
simulates
 
real
 
interview
 
conditions.
 
This
 
step
 
helps
 
build
 
comfort
 
with
 
the
 
question-and-answer
 
flow
 
while
 
identifying
 
areas
 
needing
 
improvement.
 
Objective:
 
Experience
 
realistic
 
interview
 
pressure
 
while
 
receiving
 
immediate
 
feedback
 
on
 
performance.
 
Sample
 
Prompt:
 
Let's
 
do
 
a
 
mock
 
interview .
 
You
 
are
 
an
 
interviewer
 
for
 
a
 
junior
 
data
 
analyst
 
position
 
at
 
a
 
technology
 
company .
 
 
 
-
 
Ask
 
me
 
one
 
question
 
at
 
a
 
time.
 
-
 
After
 
I
 
answer
 
(I'll
 
either
 
say
 
it
 
or
 
type
 
it),
 
provide
 
brief
 
feedback
 
on
 
my
 
answer
 
and
 
then
 
the
 
next
 
question.
 
-
 
Start
 
by
 
greeting
 
me
 
and
 
asking
 
the
 
first
 
question.
 
The
 
AI
 
will
 
initiate
 
a
 
professional
 
greeting
 
and
 
begin
 
with
 
a
 
logical
 
first
 
question,
 
such
 
as:
 
"Hello,
 
thanks
 
for
 
coming
 
in
 
today .
 
To
 
start,
 
could
 
you
 
tell
 
me
 
about
 
yourself
 
and
 
why
 
you're
 
interested
 
in
 
this
 
data
 
analyst
 
role?"
 
After
 
each
 
response,
 
the
 
AI
 
provides
 
constructive
 
feedback
 
focusing
 
on
 
content
 
quality ,
 
structure,
 
and
 
areas
 
for
 
improvement.
 
This
 
immediate
 
feedback
 
loop
 
accelerates
 
learning
 
and
 
systematically
 
builds
 
interview
 
skills.

Best
 
Practices:
 
●
 
Treat

sessions
 
seriously
 
by

and
 
speaking
 
aloud
 
●
 
Focus
 
on
 
one
 
improvement
 
area
 
per

when
 
possible
 
to
 
review
 
your
 
actual
 
delivery

Gradually
 
increase
 
the
 
session
 
length
 
to
 
build
 
endurance
