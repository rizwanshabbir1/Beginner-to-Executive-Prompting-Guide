coach,
 
create
 
a
 
framework
 
for
 
identifying
 
and
 
testing
 
the
 
key

underlying
 
our
 
[PLAN/STRA TEGY/CONCLUSION].

analysis
 
that
 
includes
 
the
 
following:

Structured
 
approach
 
to
 
surfacing
 
implicit
 
assumptions
 
2)
 
Classification
 
of
 
assumptions
 
by
 
type
 
(factual,
 
causal,
 
predictive,
 
etc.)
 
3)
 
Assessment
 
of
 
each
 
assumption's
 
criticality
 
to
 
conclusions
 
4)
 
Evidence
 
standards
 
for
 
validating
 
different
 
types
 
of
 
assumptions
 
5)
 
Testing
 
methodologies
 
for
 
key
 
assumptions
 
6)
 
Alternative
 
perspectives
 
that
 
challenge
 
central
 
assumptions
 
7)
 
Sensitivity
 
analysis
 
showing
 
how
 
conclusions
 
change
 
if
 
assumptions
 
prove
 
incorrect

as
 
an
 
analytical
 
framework
 
that
 
strengthens
 
critical
 
thinking
