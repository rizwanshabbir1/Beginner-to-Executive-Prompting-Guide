Prompt:
 
Why
 
do
 
we
 
keep
 
having
 
this
 
recurring
 
problem?
 
Executive
 
Prompt:
 
As
 
a
 
process
 
improvement
 
specialist,
 
conduct
 
a
 
thorough
 
root
 
cause
 
analysis
 
of
 
the
 
recurring
 
[PROBLEM/ISSUE].
 
 
Apply
 
the
 
following
 
analytical
 
framework:
 
1)
 
Define
 
the
 
problem
 
with
 
a
 
specific,
 
measurable
 
impact
 
2)
 
Identify
 
all
 
potential
 
causal
 
factors
 
using
 
the
 
5
 
Whys
 
methodology
 
3)
 
Categorize
 
causes
 
using
 
a
 
fishbone/Ishikawa
 
diagram
 
across
 
People,
 
Process,
 
Technology ,
 
Environment,
 
Materials,
 
and
 
Measurement
 
4)
 
Distinguish
 
between
 
correlation
 
and
 
causation
 
for
 
each
 
factor
 
5)
 
Prioritize
 
root
 
causes
 
by
 
impact
 
and
 
addressability
 
6)
 
Develop
 
specific
 
countermeasures
 
for
 
the
 
highest-priority
 
causes
 
7)
 
Suggest
 
verification
 
methods
 
to
 
confirm
 
root
 
cause
 
elimination
 
 
Format
 
as
 
a
 
structured
 
analysis
 
that
 
moves
 
beyond
 
symptoms
 
to
 
fundamental
 
causes
 
while
 
providing
 
actionable
 
mitigation
 
strategies.
 
Why
 
It
 
Works:
 
●
 
Multiple
 
analytical
 
tools
 
(5
 
Whys,
 
fishbone)
 
ensure
 
comprehensive
 
analysis.
 
●
 
The
 
correlationThe
 
distinction
 
between
 
correlation
 
and
 
causation
 
prevents
 
addressing
 
non-causal
 
factors.
 
●
 
Verification
 
methods
 
ensure
 
that
 
effectiveness
 
can
 
be
 
measured.
 
Optional
 
Add-On:
 
"Include
 
a
 
systemic
 
analysis
 
section
 
that
 
identifies
 
interactions
 
between
 
causal
 
factors
 
and
 
potential
 
unintended
 
consequences
 
of
 
interventions."
