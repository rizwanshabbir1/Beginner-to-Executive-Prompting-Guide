Comparative
 
Evaluation
 
Quick-Look
 
Definition:
 
Systematically
 
comparing
 
multiple
 
options
 
across
 
standard
 
dimensions.
 
Starter
 
Prompt:
 
Compare
 
these
 
three
 
approaches
 
to
 
solving
 
this
 
problem.
 
Executive
 
Prompt:
 
As
 
a
 
systems
 
analyst,
 
conduct
 
a
 
structured
 
comparison
 
of
 
[APPROACH
 
A],
 
[APPROACH
 
B],
 
and
 
[APPROACH
 
C]
 
for
 
addressing
 
[SITUA TION/PROBLEM].
 
 
For
 
each
 
approach:
 
1)
 
Summarize
 
the
 
core
 
methodology
 
and
 
underlying
 
assumptions
 
2)
 
Evaluate
 
against
 
five
 
key
 
dimensions:
 
effectiveness,
 
efficiency ,
 
risk,
 
scalability ,
 
and
 
implementation
 
requirements
 
3)
 
Identify
 
specific
 
scenarios
 
where
 
each
 
would
 
be
 
optimal
 
4)
 
Document
 
limitations
 
and
 
potential
 
failure
 
modes
 
 
Present
 
as
 
a
 
comprehensive
 
analytical
 
comparison
 
that
 
highlights
 
relative
 
strengths
 
rather
 
than
 
reaching
 
a
 
single
 
recommendation.
 
Why
 
It
 
Works:
 
●
 
Multi-dimensional
 
evaluation
 
prevents
 
oversimplified
 
comparison.
 
●
 
Scenario-specific
 
analysis
 
acknowledges
 
that
 
optimal
 
solutions
 
often
 
depend
 
on
 
context.
 
●
 
Limitations
 
documentation
 
ensures
 
a
 
balanced
 
assessment.
 
Optional
 
Add-On:
 
"Include
 
a
 
decision
 
matrix
 
that
 
weights
 
each
 
dimension
 
according
 
to
 
our
 
specific
 
context
 
to
 
determine
 
the
 
most
 
appropriate
 
approach
 
for
 
our
 
situation."
