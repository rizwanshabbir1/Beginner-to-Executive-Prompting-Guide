(where
 
information
 
naturally
 
disappears
 
after
 
being
 
exchanged)
 
and
 
interactions
 
with
 
AI
 
systems
 
(where
 
information
 
may
 
persist
 
indefinitely
 
in
 
logs,
 
training
 
datasets,
 
or
 
vendor
 
systems).
 
This
 
awareness
 
transforms
 
how
 
they
 
structure
 
prompts—applying
 
thoughtful
 
data
 
minimization
 
principles,
 
carefully
 
anonymizing
 
examples,
 
and
 
developing
 
an
 
intuitive
 
understanding
 
of
 
which
 
business
 
information
 
should
 
never
 
be
 
shared
 
with
 
external
 
systems.
 
They
 
recognize
 
that
 
"shadow
 
AI"
 
usage—employing
 
unauthorized
 
tools
 
that
 
circumvent
 
organizational
 
security
 
protocols—creates
 
significant
 
vulnerabilities,
 
even
 
when
 
motivated
 
by
 
productivity-enhancing
 
intentions.
 
The
 
Intervention
 
Framework
 
How
 
can
 
we
 
apply
 
these
 
principles
 
in
 
practice?
 
The
 
most
 
effective
 
organizations
 
develop
 
clear
 
frameworks
 
for
 
human
 
intervention
 
in
 
AI
 
processes.
 
These
 
frameworks
 
identify
 
high-stakes
 
decision
 
points
 
where
 
errors
 
could
 
have
 
a
 
significant
 
impact
 
on
 
individuals,
 
business
 
outcomes,
 
or
 
reputation.
 
Consider
 
implementing
 
tiered
 
review
 
processes
 
based
 
on
 
risk
 
levels:
 
1.
 
Low-risk,
 
routine
 
tasks
 
might
 
need
 
only
 
spot-checking
 
and
 
occasional
 
review
 
2.
 
Medium-risk
 
decisions
 
benefit
 
from
 
regular
 
sampling
 
and
 
pattern
 
analysis
 
3.
 
High-consequence
 
decisions
 
require
 
consistent
 
human
 
review
 
and
 
often
 
benefit
 
from
 
the
 
"four-eyes
 
principle"—having
 
two
 
different
 
people
 
evaluate
 
important
 
decisions
 
before
 
finalization
 
These
 
review
 
frameworks
 
aren't
 
implemented
 
arbitrarily
 
but
 
are
 
calibrated
 
through
 
thoughtful
 
risk
 
assessment.
 
Organizations
 
systematically
 
document
 
specific
 
indicators
 
that
 
should
 
trigger
 
enhanced
 
scrutiny:
 
●
 
Content
 
containing
 
uncharacteristic
 
recommendations
 
that
 
deviate
 
from
 
historical
 
patterns
 
or
 
established
 
business
 
practices
 
●
 
Outputs
 
addressing
 
legally
 
sensitive
 
domains
 
such
 
as
 
regulatory
 
compliance,
 
employment
 
guidance,
 
or
 
financial
 
counsel
 
●
 
Communications
 
that
 
will
 
represent
 
the
 
organization
 
publicly
 
or
 
reach
 
substantial
 
external
 
audiences
 
●
 
Determinations
 
that
 
significantly
 
impact
 
individual
 
stakeholders'
 
opportunities,
 
finances,
 
or
 
experiences
 
●
 
Responses
 
where
 
the
 
AI
 
system
 
itself
 
displays
 
markers
 
of
 
uncertainty ,
 
such
 
as
 
equivocation,
 
conflicting
 
rationales,
 
or
 
multiple
 
conditional
 
statements
