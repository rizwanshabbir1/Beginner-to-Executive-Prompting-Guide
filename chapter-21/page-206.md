These
 
insights
 
help
 
identify
 
where
 
additional

adjustments
 
might
 
be
 
needed.
 
Foster
 
cross-functional
 
collaboration
 
around
 
AI
 
oversight.
 
Different
 
perspectives
 
help
 
catch
 
potential
 
issues—legal
 
teams
 
might
 
spot
 
compliance
 
concerns,
 
marketing
 
might
 
identify
 
brand
 
inconsistencies,
 
and
 
customer
 
service
 
might
 
recognize
 
usability
 
challenges.
 
Creating
 
regular
 
touchpoints
 
across
 
these
 
functions
 
strengthens
 
your
 
overall
 
governance.
 
Effective
 
AI
 
governance
 
additionally
 
requires
 
transparent
 
escalation
 
pathways
 
for
 
addressing
 
identified
 
concerns.
 
Every
 
professional
 
interacting
 
with
 
AI
 
systems
 
should
 
clearly
 
understand
 
the
 
following:
 
●
 
Which
 
specific
 
AI
 
behaviors
 
or
 
outputs
 
warrant
 
immediate
 
escalation
 
●
 
The
 
appropriate
 
organizational
 
contacts
 
for
 
different
 
categories
 
of
 
concerns
 
●
 
Essential
 
information
 
to
 
include
 
when
 
documenting
 
problematic
 
interactions
 
●
 
Expected
 
response
 
timeframes
 
for
 
various
 
urgency
 
levels
 
●
 
How
 
reported
 
issues
 
influence
 
ongoing
 
system
 
improvements
 
These
 
escalation
 
protocols
 
should
 
prioritize
 
accessibility
 
and
 
clarity—overly
 
complex
 
procedures
 
frequently
 
go
 
unused,
 
while
 
straightforward
 
frameworks
 
encourage
 
consistent
 
reporting.
 
Many
 
organizations
 
implement
 
simple
 
structured
 
templates
 
that
 
standardize
 
issue
 
documentation,
 
ensuring
 
comprehensive
 
information
 
capture
 
while
 
minimizing
 
reporting
 
friction.
 
The
 
Daily
 
Practice
 
of
 
Ethical
 
AI
 
Engagement
 
Transforming
 
responsible
 
AI
 
principles
 
from
 
theoretical
 
ideals
 
to
 
operational
 
reality
 
requires
 
concrete
 
daily
 
practices.
 
Many
 
organizations
 
find
 
success
 
in
 
implementing
 
checklist-driven
 
approaches
 
that
 
systematize
 
critical
 
verification
 
steps.
 
Just
 
as
 
aviation
 
safety
 
relies
 
on
 
pre-flight
 
checklists
 
regardless
 
of
 
pilot
 
experience,
 
AI
 
interactions
 
benefit
 
from
 
consistent
 
verification
 
routines.
 
A
 
practical
 
daily
 
verification
 
framework
 
might
 
include:
 
●
 
Confirming
 
alignment
 
between
 
the
 
current
 
AI
 
application
 
and
 
approved
 
organizational
 
use
 
cases
 
●
 
Verifying
 
appropriate
 
data
 
handling
 
practices,
 
including
 
proper
 
anonymization
 
of
 
sensitive
 
information
 
●
 
Implementing
 
appropriate
 
fact-verification
 
procedures
 
for
 
critical
 
assertions
