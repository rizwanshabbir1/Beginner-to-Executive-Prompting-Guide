Education

professionals
 
design
 
learning
 
experiences
 
that
 
efficiently
 
and
 
effectively
 
build
 
knowledge
 
and
 
skills.
 
AI
 
prompting
 
can
 
enhance
 
these
 
functions
 
by
 
creating
 
instructional
 
materials,
 
developing
 
assessments,
 
personalizing
 
learning
 
paths,
 
and
 
organizing
 
curriculum
 
content.
 
The
 
prompts
 
in
 
this
 
chapter
 
help
 
educators
 
and
 
trainers
 
design
 
more
 
engaging
 
and
 
compelling
 
learning
 
experiences.
 
Effective
 
education
 
prompting
 
requires
 
learning
 
science
 
principles,
 
audience-appropriate
 
communication,
 
and
 
structured
 
instructional
 
design
 
that
 
promotes
 
knowledge
 
retention
 
and
 
application.
 
These
 
specialized
 
prompt
 
frameworks
 
support
 
various
 
educational
 
workflows—from
 
lesson
 
planning
 
and
 
content
 
creation
 
to
 
assessment
 
development
 
and
 
learning
 
analysis—while
 
adapting
 
to
 
diverse
 
educational
 
contexts,
 
including
 
K-12
 
and
 
higher
 
education,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
corporate
 
training
 
and
 
professional
 
development.
