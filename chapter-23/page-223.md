I'm
 
trying
 
to
 
understand
 
market
 
segmentation
 
strategies
 
better .
 
Instead
 
of
 
just
 
explaining
 
them
 
to
 
me,
 
please
 
use
 
a
 
Socratic
 
approach
 
where
 
you
 
ask
 
me
 
guiding
 
questions
 
that
 
help
 
me
 
think
 
through
 
the
 
key
 
considerations,
 
standard
 
techniques,
 
and
 
evaluation
 
methods.
 
After
 
each
 
of
 
my
 
responses,
 
provide
 
brief
 
feedback
 
and
 
then
 
a
 
new
 
question
 
to
 
deepen
 
my
 
understanding.
