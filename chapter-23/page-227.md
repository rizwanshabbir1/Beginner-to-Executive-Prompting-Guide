Multimodal
 
models
 
that
 
integrate
 
text,
 
images,
 
and
 
soon
 
video
 
require
 
evolving
 
prompt
 
strategies
 
that
 
consider
 
all
 
content
 
types.

Chain-of-thought
 
reasoning
 
models
 
allow
 
for
 
increasingly
 
sophisticated
 
analysis
 
when
 
properly
 
guided.
 
Yet
 
even
 
as
 
tools
 
advance,
 
the
 
core
 
principles
 
we've
 
covered—clarity ,
 
structure,
 
role
 
assignment,
 
and
 
context
 
provision—will
 
remain
 
essential.
 
The
 
future
 
belongs
 
not
 
to
 
those
 
who
 
can
 
write
 
the
 
most
 
complex
 
prompts
 
but
 
to
 
those
 
who
 
can
 
communicate
 
their
 
business
 
intent
 
to
 
increasingly
 
capable
 
AI
 
systems.
 
Your
 
Path
 
Forward
 
We
 
encourage
 
you
 
to
 
approach
 
prompt
 
mastery
 
as
 
an
 
ongoing
 
practice
 
rather
 
than
 
a
 
one-time
 
learning:
 
1.
 
Start
 
simple.
 
Begin
 
with
 
the
 
starter
 
prompts
 
from
 
areas
 
most
 
relevant
 
to
 
your
 
daily
 
work.
 
2.
 
Build
 
your
 
library.
 
Create
 
a
 
personal
 
or
 
team
 
repository
 
of
 
effective
 
prompts
 
that
 
solve
 
recurring
 
problems.
 
3.
 
Measure
 
impact
:
 
track
 
time
 
saved,
 
quality
 
improvements,
 
or
 
other
 
relevant
 
metrics
 
to
 
quantify
 
value.
 
4.
 
Share
 
knowledge.
 
Establish
 
prompt-sharing
 
practices
 
within
 
teams
 
to
 
accelerate
 
organizational
 
learning
 
and
 
knowledge
 
sharing.
 
5.
 
Stay
 
curious.
 
As
 
models
 
evolve,
 
experiment
 
with
 
new
 
capabilities
 
and
 
techniques.
 
The
 
most
 
successful
 
leaders
 
we've
 
worked
 
with
 
don't
 
treat
 
prompt
 
engineering
 
as
 
a
 
technical
 
specialty—they
 
view
 
it
 
as
 
a
 
core
 
communication
 
skill.
 
They
 
recognize
 
that
 
the
 
ability
 
to
 
convey
 
business
 
requirements
 
to
 
AI
 
systems
 
effectively
 
is
 
rapidly
 
becoming
 
as
 
fundamental
 
as
 
the
 
ability
 
to
 
write
 
a
 
clear
 
email
 
or
 
deliver
 
a
 
compelling
 
presentation.
 
In
 
a
 
world
 
where
 
AI
 
capabilities
 
double
 
approximately
 
every
 
six
 
months,
 
the
 
strategic
 
advantage
 
doesn't
 
come
 
from
 
having
 
access
 
to
 
the
 
newest
 
models—it
 
comes
 
from
 
knowing
 
how
 
to
 
use
 
them
 
most
 
effectively .
 
The
 
frameworks
 
in
 
this
 
guide
 
provide
 
that
 
advantage
 
today ,
 
and
 
the
 
mindset
 
of
 
structured
 
communication
 
with
 
AI
 
will
 
serve
 
you
 
well
 
as
 
capabilities
 
continue
 
to
 
advance.
 
We
 
hope
 
this
 
guide
 
has
 
demystified
 
prompt
 
engineering
 
and
 
equipped
 
you
 
with
 
practical
 
tools
 
to
 
transform
 
how
 
your
 
organization
 
leverages
 
AI.
 
The
 
future
 
belongs
 
to
 
those
 
who
