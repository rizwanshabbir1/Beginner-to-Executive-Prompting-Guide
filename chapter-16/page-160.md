As
 
a
 
technical
 
documentation
 
specialist,
 
create
 
a
 
comprehensive
 
documentation
 
framework
 
for
 
our
 
[SYSTEM/PROCESS/PROCEDURE].
 
 
Design
 
a
 
documentation
 
approach
 
including:
 
1)
 
System
 
overview
 
with
 
architecture
 
and
 
component
 
relationships
 
2)
 
Functional
 
descriptions
 
of
 
key
 
components
 
and
 
their
 
purposes
 
3)
 
Process
 
flows
 
with
 
decision
 
points
 
and
 
exception
 
handling
 
4)
 
Configuration
 
settings
 
and
 
their
 
impact
 
on
 
behavior
 
5)

Format
 
as
 
a
 
complete
 
documentation
 
system
 
that
 
serves
 
both
 
new
 
users
 
needing
 
conceptual
 
understanding
 
and
 
experienced
 
users
 
requiring
 
specific
 
technical
 
details.
 
Why
 
It
 
Works:
 
●
 
Multiple
 
levels
 
of
 
detail
 
serve
 
diverse
 
audience
 
needs.
 
●
 
Process
 
flows
 
capture
 
dynamic
 
behaviors
 
beyond
 
static
 
descriptions.
 
●
 
Maintenance
 
and
 
change
 
management
 
aspects
 
ensure
 
documentation
 
remains
 
current.
 
Optional
 
Add-On:
 
"Include
 
a
 
documentation
 
template
 
structure
 
that
 
can
 
be
 
applied
 
consistently
 
across
 
systems
 
or
 
processes."
