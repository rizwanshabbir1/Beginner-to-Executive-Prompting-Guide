Definition:
 
Assessing
 
and
 
prioritizing
 
potential
 
strategic

against
 
criteria
 
and
 
constraints.

Prompt:
 
As
 
an
 
opportunity
 
assessment
 
specialist,
 
create
 
a
 
comprehensive
 
evaluation
 
framework
 
for
 
[OPPOR TUNITY
 
TYPE]
 
we
 
are
 
considering.
 
 
Develop
 
a
 
structured
 
evaluation
 
approach
 
including:
 
1)
 
Multi-dimensional
 
assessment
 
criteria
 
with
 
weightings
 
(strategic
 
fit,
 
market
 
potential,
 
capability
 
requirements,
 
risk
 
profile,
 
resource
 
needs)
 
2)
 
Quantitative
 
modeling
 
of
 
key
 
financial
 
metrics
 
and
 
assumptions
 
3)
 
Competitive
 
response
 
scenarios
 
and
 
their
 
implications
 
4)
 
Implementation
 
requirements
 
and
 
timeline
 
assessment
 
5)
 
Resource
 
commitment
 
and
 
staging
 
approach
 
6)
 
Risk
 
identification
 
with
 
mitigation
 
strategies
 
7)
 
Key
 
success
 
factors
 
and
 
early
 
performance
 
indicators
 
 
Format
 
as
 
a
 
balanced
 
opportunity
 
assessment
 
that
 
combines
 
rigorous
 
analysis
 
with
 
practical
 
implementation
 
considerations
 
while
 
acknowledging
 
uncertainties.
 
Why
 
It
 
Works:
 
●
 
Multi-dimensional
 
criteria
 
prevent
 
over-focusing
 
on
 
financial
 
metrics
 
alone.
 
●
 
Competitive
 
response
 
consideration
 
acknowledges
 
dynamic
 
market
 
realities.
 
●
 
The
 
staging
 
approach
 
allows
 
for
 
milestone-based
 
commitment
 
rather
 
than
 
all-or-nothing
 
decisions.
 
Optional
 
Add-On:
 
"Include
 
an
 
opportunity
 
portfolio
 
view
 
that
 
shows
 
how
 
this
 
opportunity
 
fits
 
with
 
other
 
initiatives
 
in
 
terms
 
of
 
risk/reward
 
profile
 
and
 
resource
 
requirements."
