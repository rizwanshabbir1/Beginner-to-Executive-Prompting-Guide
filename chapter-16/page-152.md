Scenario
 
Planning
 
Quick-Look
 
Definition:
 
Developing
 
structured
 
approaches
 
to
 
anticipate
 
and
 
prepare
 
for
 
alternative
 
future
 
states.
 
Starter
 
Prompt:
 
How
 
might
 
our
 
industry
 
evolve
 
over
 
the
 
next
 
five
 
years?
 
Executive
 
Prompt:
 
As
 
a
 
strategic
 
foresight
 
specialist,
 
develop
 
a
 
comprehensive
 
scenario
 
planning
 
framework
 
for
 
[ORGANIZA TION/INDUSTR Y]
 
over
 
the
 
next
 
[TIMEFRAME].
 
 
Create
 
a
 
structured
 
approach
 
including:
 
1)
 
5-7
 
critical
 
uncertainties
 
that
 
could
 
significantly
 
impact
 
future
 
outcomes
 
2)
 
2x2
 
scenario
 
matrix
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
two
 
most
 
essential
 
uncertainties
 
3)
 
Detailed
 
narrative
 
for
 
each
 
quadrant
 
describing
 
the
 
business
 
environment,
 
customer
 
behavior ,
 
competitive
 
landscape,
 
and
 
technology
 
evolution
 
4)
 
Opportunity
 
and
 
threat
 
assessment
 
for
 
each
 
scenario
 
5)
 
Early
 
indicators
 
that
 
would
 
signal
 
movement
 
toward
 
each
 
scenario
 
6)
 
Strategic
 
response
 
options
 
that
 
would
 
position
 
us
 
well
 
across
 
multiple
 
scenarios
 
7)
 
"No-regrets"
 
moves
 
that
 
make
 
sense
 
regardless
 
of
 
which
 
scenario
 
unfolds
 
 
Format
 
as
 
a
 
strategic
 
foresight
 
framework
 
that
 
prepares
 
the
 
organization
 
for
 
multiple
 
futures
 
rather
 
than
 
predicting
 
a
 
single
 
outcome.
 
Why
 
It
 
Works:
 
●
 
Multiple
 
uncertainties
 
create
 
more
 
nuanced
 
future
 
possibilities.
 
●
 
Detailed
 
narratives
 
make
 
abstract
 
futures
 
tangible
 
for
 
planning.
 
●
 
Early
 
indicators
 
create
 
an
 
ongoing
 
monitoring
 
system.
 
Optional
 
Add-On:
 
"Include
 
a
 
portfolio
 
approach
 
to
 
strategic
 
initiatives
 
that
 
balance
 
'core,'
 
'adjacent,'
 
and
 
'transformational'
 
opportunities
 
across
 
scenarios."
