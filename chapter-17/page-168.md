Constraints
 
guide
 
AI
 
output
 
format,
 
length,
 
tone,
 
and
 
focus
 
areas.
 
Without
 
limitations,
 
responses
 
may
 
be
 
too
 
lengthy ,
 
inappropriately
 
formatted,
 
or
 
fail
 
to
 
meet
 
your
 
specific
 
requirements.
 
Practical
 
constraints
 
might
 
specify
 
response
 
length,
 
organizational
 
structure,
 
tone
 
of
 
voice,
 
or
 
particular
 
elements
 
to
 
include
 
or
 
avoid.
 
Examples
 
of
 
applicable
 
constraints:
 
●
 
"Limit
 
responses
 
to
 
two
 
minutes
 
of
 
speaking
 
time."
 
●
 
"Format
 
as
 
a
 
table
 
with
 
columns
 
for
 
Question,
 
Key
 
Points,
 
and
 
Example."
 
●
 
"Use
 
a
 
confident
 
but
 
humble
 
tone."
 
●
 
"Include
 
specific
 
metrics
 
or
 
results
 
where
 
possible."
 
Constrained
 
prompt

"Create
 
a
 
90-second
 
elevator
 
pitch
 
for
 
a
 
project
 
manager
 
transitioning
 
to
 
healthcare
 
technology .
 
Format
 
it
 
with
 
three
 
clear
 
sections:
 
background,
 
relevant
 
skills,
 
and
 
career
 
goals.
 
Use
 
an
 
enthusiastic

Cycle:
 
Iterative
 
Refinement
 
The
 
Cycle
 
principle
 
recognizes
 
that
 
initial
 
AI
 
responses
 
often
 
require
 
refinement.
 
Instead
 
of
 
accepting
 
the
 
first
 
output,
 
use
 
follow-up
 
prompts
 
to
 
clarify ,
 
expand,
 
or
 
modify
 
reactions
 
as
 
needed.
 
This
 
iterative
 
approach
 
leads
 
to
 
increasingly
 
precise
 
and
 
valuable
 
results.
 
Example
 
of
 
cycling:
 
1.
 
Initial
 
prompt:
 
"Help
 
me
 
answer
 
'Why
 
do
 
you
 
want
 
to
 
work
 
here?'
 
for
 
a
 
consulting
 
firm
 
interview ."
