Quick-Look
 
Definition:
 
Creating
 
structured
 
approaches
 
to
 
address
 
technical
 
problems
 
or
 
requirements.
 
Starter
 
Prompt:
 
Design
 
a
 
solution
 
for
 
our
 
data
 
storage
 
needs.
 
Executive
 
Prompt:
 
As
 
a
 
solutions
 
architect,
 
develop
 
a
 
comprehensive
 
approach
 
to
 
addressing
 
our
 
[REQUIREMENT/PROBLEM]
 
for
 
[FUNCTION/SYSTEM].
 
 
Create
 
a
 
structured
 
solution
 
design
 
including:
 
1)
 
Requirements
 
analysis
 
with
 
functional
 
and
 
non-functional
 
specifications
 
2)
 
Solution
 
options
 
evaluation
 
with
 
pros/cons
 
of
 
different
 
approaches
 
3)
 
Recommended
 
architecture
 
with
 
component
 
descriptions
 
and
 
interactions
 
4)
 
Implementation
 
considerations
 
and
 
dependencies
 
5)
 
Performance,
 
security ,
 
and
 
scalability
 
characteristics
 
6)
 
Testing
 
strategy
 
to
 
validate
 
solution
 
effectiveness
 
7)
 
Deployment
 
approach
 
and
 
transition
 
considerations
 
 
Format
 
as
 
a
 
solution
 
design
 
document
 
that
 
balances
 
technical
 
elegance
 
with
 
practical
 
implementation
 
factors
 
while
 
addressing
 
all
 
critical
 
requirements.
 
Why
 
It
 
Works:
 
●
 
Multiple
 
solution
 
options
 
prevent
 
premature
 
convergence
 
on
 
a
 
single
 
approach.
 
●
 
Non-functional
 
requirements
 
ensure
 
that
 
performance
 
and
 
operational
 
factors
 
are
 
addressed.
 
●
 
Implementation
 
and
 
deployment
 
considerations
 
bridge
 
from
 
design
 
to
 
execution.
 
Optional
 
Add-On:
 
"Include
 
a
 
phased
 
implementation
 
plan
 
that
 
allows
 
for
 
incremental
 
delivery
 
of
 
value
 
while
 
managing
 
risk."
