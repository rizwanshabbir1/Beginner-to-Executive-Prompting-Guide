The

of

for

Preparation
 
Effective
 
communication
 
with
 
AI
 
systems
 
requires
 
understanding
 
how
 
to
 
structure
 
your
 
requests
 
for
 
optimal
 
results.
 
The
 
Four
 
Cs
 
framework—Clarity ,
 
Context,
 
Constraints,
 
and
 
Cycle—provides
 
a
 
systematic
 
approach
 
to
 
crafting
 
prompts
 
that
 
elicit
 
useful
 
and
 
relevant
 
responses
 
for
 
interview
 
preparation.
 
Clarity:
 
Precision
 
in
 
Your
 
Requests
 
Clarity
 
involves
 
stating
 
your
 
needs
 
explicitly
 
and
 
specifically .
 
Vague
 
prompts
 
produce
 
generic
 
responses
 
that
 
offer
 
limited
 
value
 
for
 
interview
 
preparation.
 
Instead
 
of
 
asking,
 
"How
 
do
 
I
 
prepare
 
for
 
interviews?"
 
specify
 
the
 
exact
 
type
 
of
 
guidance
 
you
 
need:
 
particular
 
question
 
categories,
 
response
 
frameworks,
 
or
 
improvement
 
areas.
 
Example
 
of
 
unclear
 
prompt:
 
"Give
 
me
 
interview
 
help."
 
Example
 
of
 
clear
 
prompt:
 
"Generate
 
five
 
behavioral
 
interview
 
questions
 
specifically
 
for
 
an
 
entry-level
 
marketing
 
coordinator
 
position,
 
focusing
 
on
 
teamwork
 
and
 
problem-solving
 
scenarios."
 
The
 
clear
 
prompt
 
specifies
 
the
 
question
 
type
 
(behavioral),
 
quantity
 
(five),
 
role
 
level
 
(entry-level),
 
function
 
(marketing
 
coordinator),
 
and
 
competency
 
areas
 
(teamwork
 
and
 
problem-solving),
 
enabling
 
AI
 
to
 
provide
 
targeted,
 
relevant
 
questions.
 
Context:
 
Providing
 
Relevant
 
Background
 
Information
 
Context
 
helps
 
AI
 
understand
 
your
 
specific
 
situation
 
and
 
tailor
 
responses
 
accordingly .
 
This
 
includes
 
details
 
about
 
the
 
target
 
role,
 
company
 
type,
 
your
 
experience
 
level,
 
and
 
any
 
particular
 
challenges
 
you're
 
facing.
 
The
 
more
 
relevant
 
context
 
you
 
provide,
 
the
 
more
 
customized
 
and
 
helpful
 
the
 
AI's
 
guidance
 
becomes.
