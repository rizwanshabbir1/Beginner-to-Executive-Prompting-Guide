AI
 
has
 
changed
 
job
 
interviews
 
and
 
hiring
 
in
 
both
 
fundamental
 
and
 
sweeping
 
ways.
 
While
 
traditional
 
preparation
 
methods—such
 
as
 
memorizing
 
answers,
 
researching
 
company
 
facts,
 
and
 
practicing
 
in
 
front
 
of
 
mirrors—remain
 
valuable,
 
today's
 
most
 
successful
 
candidates
 
are
 
leveraging
 
artificial
 
intelligence
 
as
 
their
 
interview
 
coach.
 
This
 
revolutionary
 
approach
 
combines
 
the
 
accessibility
 
of
 
AI
 
with
 
the
 
structured
 
methodology
 
of
 
prompt
 
engineering
 
to
 
create
 
a
 
comprehensive
 
preparation
 
system
 
that
 
adapts
 
to
 
your
 
specific
 
needs,
 
is
 
available
 
24/7,
 
and
 
never
 
grows
 
tired
 
of
 
your
 
questions.
