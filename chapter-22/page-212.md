Glossary
 
Chain-of-Thought
 
Prompting
 
Instructing
 
the
 
AI
 
to
 
show
 
its
 
reasoning
 
step
 
by
 
step
 
before
 
providing
 
a
 
final
 
answer .
 
It
 
is
 
particularly
 
effective
 
for
 
complex
 
reasoning,
 
mathematical
 
problems,
 
or
 
any
 
situation
 
requiring
 
a
 
logical
 
progression
 
of
 
thought.
 
Example:
 
"Think
 
through
 
this
 
problem
 
step
 
by
 
step
 
before
 
providing
 
your
 
final
 
answer ."
 
Few-Shot
 
Prompting
 
Provide
 
a
 
few
 
examples
 
of
 
the
 
desired
 
input-output
 
pattern
 
before
 
asking
 
the
 
AI
 
to
 
perform
 
a
 
similar
 
task.
 
This
 
helps
 
establish
 
the
 
expected
 
format,
 
style,
 
or
 
approach.
 
Example:
 
"Here
 
are
 
two
 
examples
 
of
 
how
 
to
 
convert
 
customer
 
inquiries
 
into
 
support
 
tickets:
 
[Example
 
1],
 
[Example
 
2].
 
Now
 
convert
 
this
 
new
 
inquiry
 
into
 
the
 
same
 
format."
 
Role
 
Prompting
 
Assigning
 
a
 
specific
 
role
 
or
 
expertise
 
to
 
the
 
AI
 
to
 
activate
 
relevant
 
knowledge
 
patterns
 
and
 
response
 
styles.
 
Example:
 
"As
 
an
 
experienced
 
financial
 
analyst,
 
evaluate
 
this
 
investment
 
opportunity ..."
 
Template
 
Variables
 
Placeholders
 
in
 
reusable
 
prompt
 
templates
 
that
 
can
 
be
 
filled
 
with
 
specific
 
information
 
for
 
different
 
use
 
cases.
 
Example
 
Format
 
from
 
Claude:
 
"Generate
 
a
 
social
 
media
 
post
 
about
 
{{topic}}
 
targeting
 
{{audience}}
 
with
 
a
 
tone
 
that
 
is
 
{{tone}}."
 
Constraint
 
Specification
 
Explicitly
 
defining
 
limitations,
 
requirements,
 
or
 
boundaries
 
for
 
the
 
AI's
 
response.
 
Example:
 
"Create
 
a
 
marketing
 
email
 
that
 
is
 
under
 
200
 
words,
 
includes
 
exactly
 
three
 
bullet
 
points,
 
and
 
ends
 
with
 
a
 
clear
 
call-to-action."
 
Output
 
Structuring
 
Specifying
 
the
 
exact
 
format,
 
organization,
 
or
 
layout
 
for
 
the
 
AI's
 
response.
 
Example:
 
"Present
 
your
 
analysis
 
in
 
a
 
table
 
with
 
the
 
following
 
columns:
 
Opportunity ,
 
Potential
 
Impact
 
(1-5),
 
Implementation
 
Difficulty
 
(1-5),
 
and
 
Recommended
 
Timeline."
