For
 
example,
 
instead
 
of
 
saying:
 
"Customer
 
Jane
 
Smith
 
(account
 
#12345)
 
complained
 
about
 
our
 
premium
 
service
 
on
 
March
 
15th,
 
stating
 
the
 
$1,299
 
annual
 
fee
 
was
 
too
 
high
 
compared
 
to
 
competitor
 
XYZ's
 
offering..."
 
You
 
could
 
rephrase
 
it
 
as:
 
"A
 
customer
 
expressed
 
concerns
 
about
 
our
 
premium
 
tier
 
pricing,
 
noting
 
it
 
was
 
higher
 
than
 
a
 
competitor's
 
similar
 
offering..."
 
Consider
 
creating
 
templates
 
for
 
everyday
 
AI
 
interactions
 
that
 
employees
 
can
 
adapt
 
to
 
their
 
needs
 
while
 
maintaining
 
compliance.
 
These
 
pre-approved
 
prompt
 
structures
 
can
 
guide
 
proper
 
use
 
while
 
reducing
 
security
 
risks.
 
For
 
teams
 
that
 
regularly
 
use
 
AI
 
with
 
sensitive
 
data,
 
establish
 
a
 
peer
 
review
 
process
 
for
 
prompts
 
dealing
 
with
 
high-risk
 
information.
 
Having
 
a
 
second
 
set
 
of
 
eyes
 
review
 
prompts
 
before
 
submission
 
can
 
catch
 
potential
 
data
 
leakage
 
issues.
 
Finally ,
 
remember
 
that
 
complex
 
prompts
 
requiring
 
detailed
 
context
 
can
 
often
 
be
 
restructured
 
to
 
maintain
 
effectiveness
 
while
 
reducing
 
risk.
 
Focus
 
on
 
the
 
specific
 
question
 
or
 
task
 
without
 
revealing
 
unnecessary
 
background
 
information.
 
To
 
summarize,
 
AI
 
security
 
extends
 
beyond
 
technical
 
measures
 
to
 
include
 
how
 
everyday
 
business
 
users
 
interact
 
with
 
these
 
powerful
 
tools.
 
By
 
understanding
 
shadow
 
AI
 
risks,
 
being
 
aware
 
of
 
security
 
vulnerabilities,
 
considering
 
unintended
 
consequences,
 
and
 
practicing
 
safe
 
prompting
 
techniques,
 
you
 
can
 
help
 
protect
 
your
 
organization
 
while
 
still
 
reaping
 
the
 
benefits
 
of
 
AI
 
capabilities.

Scenarios
 
These
 
five
 
realistic
 
scenarios
 
are
 
based
 
on
 
actual
 
incidents
 
that
 
highlight
 
common
 
AI
 
security
 
risks
 
business
 
professionals
 
might
 
encounter .
 
Each
 
scenario
 
is
 
presented
 
with
 
discussion
 
questions
 
that
 
prompt
 
participants
 
to
 
identify
 
security
 
risks,
 
assess
 
potential
 
consequences,
 
propose
 
appropriate
 
mitigation
 
strategies,
 
and
 
determine
 
the
 
proper
 
escalation
 
paths
 
within
 
their
 
organization.
 
Scenario
 
1:
 
The
 
Innocent
 
Data
 
Share
 
Setting:
 
The
 
marketing
 
department
 
collaborating
 
with
 
an
 
external
 
agency
 
Situation:
 
A
 
marketing
 
manager
 
shares
 
customer
 
purchase
 
history
 
data
 
with
 
an
 
external
 
AI
 
analytics
 
firm
 
to
 
enhance
 
targeted
 
marketing.
 
The
 
data
 
is
 
exported
 
to
 
a
 
spreadsheet
 
and
 
emailed
 
without
 
encryption
 
or
 
data
 
minimization.
 
Real-life
 
basis:
 
Similar
 
to
 
the
 
Marriott
 
data
 
breach
 
where
 
unencrypted
 
customer
 
data
 
was
 
inappropriately
 
shared
 
and
 
accessed
 
by
 
unauthorized
 
parties,
 
resulting
