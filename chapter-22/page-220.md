getting
 
advice
 
from
 
someone
 
who
 
can't
 
explain
 
their
 
rationale.
 
The
 
advice
 
might
 
be
 
good,
 
but
 
without
 
understanding
 
the
 
"why,"
 
it's
 
difficult
 
to
 
judge
 
its
 
reliability .
 
In
 
business
 
settings,
 
these
 
limitations
 
matter .
 
If
 
you're
 
using
 
AI
 
to
 
draft
 
communications,
 
analyze
 
data,
 
or
 
support
 
decisions,
 
incorrect
 
outputs
 
could
 
lead
 
to
 
embarrassment
 
at
 
best
 
or
 
significant
 
business
 
impacts
 
at
 
worst.
 
PRACTICAL
 
AI
 
EVALUATION
 
TECHNIQUES
 
 
So,
 
how
 
can
 
you
 
evaluate
 
AI
 
outputs
 
without
 
becoming
 
a
 
technical
 
expert?
 
Here
 
are
 
five
 
practical
 
techniques:
 
First,
 
cross-reference
 
critical
 
information.
 
If
 
an
 
AI
 
provides
 
statistics,
 
facts,
 
or
 
quotes,
 
verify
 
these
 
with
 
trusted
 
sources
 
before
 
using
 
them
 
in
 
essential
 
contexts.
 
This
 
is
 
especially
 
crucial
 
for
 
time-sensitive
 
information
 
or
 
industry-specific
 
data.
 
Remember ,
 
many
 
AI
 
systems
 
have
 
knowledge
 
cutof f
 
dates
 
and
 
won't
 
be
 
aware
 
of
 
recent
 
developments.
 
Second,
 
check
 
for
 
consistency .
 
Try
 
asking
 
the
 
same
 
question
 
multiple
 
ways
 
or
 
break
 
complex
 
questions
 
into
 
smaller
 
parts.
 
If
 
you
 
receive
 
contradictory
 
answers,
 
that's
 
a
 
red
 
flag
 
indicating
 
the
 
AI
 
might
 
be
 
uncertain
 
or
 
experiencing
 
hallucinations.
 
Inconsistency
 
often
 
shows
 
areas
 
where
 
you
 
should
 
be
 
particularly
 
skeptical.
 
Third,
 
be
 
wary
 
of
 
responses
 
that
 
seem
 
too
 
perfect.
 
If
 
an
 
AI
 
provides
 
a
 
highly
 
comprehensive
 
answer
 
with
 
numerous
 
specific
 
details,
 
especially
 
about
 
obscure
 
topics,
 
proceed
 
with
 
caution.
 
Real
 
expertise
 
often
 
acknowledges
 
complexity
 
and
 
limitations,
 
while
 
hallucinating
 
AI
 
might
 
generate
 
impressively
 
detailed
 
but
 
fictional
 
content.
 
Fourth,
 
test
 
boundaries
 
and
 
edge
 
cases.
 
If
 
you're
 
exploring
 
a
 
topic,
 
ask
 
about
 
exceptions,
 
contradictions,
 
or
 
alternative
 
viewpoints.
 
How
 
the
 
AI
 
handles
 
these
 
challenges
 
can
 
reveal
 
its
 
limitations.
 
A
 
high-quality
 
AI
 
will
 
acknowledge
 
uncertainties
 
and
 
varying
 
perspectives
 
rather
 
than
 
presenting
 
oversimplified
 
views.
 
Fifth,
 
develop
 
a
 
sense
 
of
 
outdated
 
information.
 
Suppose
 
an
 
AI
 
refers
 
to
 
"recent
 
events"
 
from
 
two
 
years
 
ago
 
or
 
mentions
 
technology
 
or
 
policies
 
that
 
have
 
since
 
changed.
 
In
 
that
 
case,
 
that's
 
a
 
sign
 
that
 
you
 
need
 
to
 
verify
 
the
 
currency
 
of
 
all
 
information
 
provided.
