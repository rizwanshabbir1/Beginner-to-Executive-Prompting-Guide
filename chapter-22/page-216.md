Customer
 
and
 
client
 
perception
 
issues
 
can
 
arise
 
when
 
AI
 
is
 
used
 
without
 
transparency .
 
If
 
clients
 
discover
 
that
 
their
 
communications
 
were
 
drafted
 
entirely
 
by
 
AI
 
or
 
that
 
automated
 
systems
 
addressed
 
their
 
concerns
 
without
 
human
 
review ,
 
this
 
could
 
damage
 
trust—mainly
 
if
 
errors
 
occur .
 
Being
 
transparent
 
about
 
the
 
use
 
of
 
AI
 
in
 
customer
 
interactions
 
is
 
increasingly
 
important.
 
Ethical
 
considerations
 
extend
 
beyond
 
immediate
 
security
 
concerns.
 
AI
 
systems
 
can
 
perpetuate
 
or
 
amplify
 
existing
 
biases,
 
potentially
 
leading
 
to
 
discriminatory
 
outcomes
 
in
 
hiring,
 
customer
 
service,
 
or
 
product
 
development.
 
Without
 
proper
 
oversight,
 
these
 
issues
 
might
 
go
 
unnoticed
 
until
 
they
 
cause
 
reputation
 
damage
 
or
 
legal
 
problems.
 
Finally ,
 
consider
 
compliance
 
risks
 
specific
 
to
 
your
 
industry .
 
Healthcare
 
organizations
 
must
 
ensure
 
AI
 
use
 
doesn't
 
violate
 
HIPAA.
 
Financial
 
institutions
 
must
 
consider
 
regulations
 
surrounding
 
automated
 
decision-making.
 
Government
 
contractors
 
may
 
have
 
restrictions
 
on
 
the
 
locations
 
where
 
they
 
process
 
data.
 
These
 
regulatory
 
requirements
 
should
 
inform
 
your
 
approach
 
to
 
AI
 
security .
 
SAFE
 
&
 
COMPLIANT
 
PROMPTING
 
 
Let's
 
now
 
discuss
 
how
 
to
 
craft
 
prompts
 
that
 
maintain
 
security
 
and
 
compliance—the
 
concept
 
of
 
"safe
 
prompting."
 
First,
 
develop
 
clear
 
guidelines
 
about
 
what
 
should
 
never
 
be
 
included
 
in
 
prompts
 
to
 
AI
 
systems.
 
This
 
typically
 
includes:
 
Personally
 
identifiable
 
information
 
about
 
customers
 
or
 
employees
 
Financial
 
account
 
details
 
or
 
access
 
credentials
 
Proprietary
 
business
 
strategies
 
or
 
trade
 
secrets
 
Confidential
 
contract
 
terms
 
or
 
negotiations
 
Protected
 
health
 
information
 
Information
 
covered
 
by
 
non-disclosure
 
agreements
 
When
 
working
 
with
 
sensitive
 
information
 
that
 
requires
 
processing
 
by
 
AI,
 
utilize
 
anonymization
 
techniques.
 
Replace
 
actual
 
names
 
with
 
generic
 
identifiers.
 
Change
 
specific
 
dates
 
while
 
maintaining
 
relative
 
timeframes.
 
Modify
 
unique
 
identifiers,
 
such
 
as
 
account
 
numbers,
 
while
 
preserving
 
the
 
existing
 
pattern.
 
Alter
 
specific
 
dollar
 
amounts
 
while
 
maintaining
 
proportional
 
relationships.
