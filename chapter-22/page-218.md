Risk
 
identification
 
exercise:
 
Participants
 
identify
 
issues
 
related
 
to
 
unsecured
 
data
 
transmission,
 
excessive
 
data
 
sharing,
 
and
 
inadequate
 
vendor
 
security
 
assessments.
 
Scenario
 
2:
 
The
 
Conversational
 
AI
 
Overshare
 
Setting:
 
Customer
 
service
 
department
 
using
 
AI
 
chatbots
 
Situation:
 
A
 
team
 
member
 
uploads
 
customer
 
conversation
 
logs
 
to
 
a
 
public
 
AI
 
tool
 
to
 
analyze
 
sentiment
 
patterns,
 
unaware
 
that
 
the
 
conversations
 
contain
 
personal
 
identifying
 
information
 
and
 
that
 
the
 
tool
 
uses
 
these
 
uploads
 
to
 
train
 
its
 
models.
 
Real-life
 
basis:
 
Inspired
 
by
 
incidents
 
like
 
Samsung's
 
accidental
 
exposure
 
of
 
internal
 
data
 
when
 
employees
 
used
 
ChatGPT
 
for
 
code
 
debugging
 
and
 
similar
 
incidents
 
at
 
major
 
banks
 
where
 
sensitive
 
information
 
was
 
shared
 
with
 
public
 
AI
 
tools.
 
Risk
 
identification
 
exercise:
 
Participants
 
spot
 
the
 
improper
 
use
 
of
 
public
 
AI
 
tools
 
for
 
sensitive
 
data
 
and
 
the
 
implications
 
of
 
training
 
data
 
retention.
 
Scenario
 
3:
 
The
 
Helpful
 
Shortcut
 
Setting:
 
HR
 
recruitment
 
process
 
Situation:
 
An
 
HR
 
manager
 
bypasses
 
the
 
standard
 
AI-powered
 
applicant
 
screening
 
system
 
by
 
downloading
 
resumes
 
to
 
a
 
personal
 
AI
 
tool
 
for
 
faster
 
analysis,
 
as
 
the
 
company's
 
system
 
is
 
deemed
 
"too
 
slow."
 
Real-life
 
basis:
 
Similar
 
to
 
the
 
Thomson
 
Reuters
 
employee
 
data
 
leak
 
where
 
HR
 
data
 
was
 
processed
 
outside
 
approved
 
systems,
 
exposing
 
employee
 
information.
 
Risk
 
identification
 
exercise:
 
Participants
 
identify
 
shadow
 
IT
 
risks,
 
unauthorized
 
processing,
 
and
 
potential
 
bias
 
introduction
 
when
 
circumventing
 
vetted
 
systems.
 
Scenario
 
4:
 
The
 
Predictive
 
Maintenance
 
Mishap
 
Setting:
 
Operations
 
department
 
using
 
IoT
 
sensors
 
and
 
AI
 
Situation:
 
An
 
operations
 
team
 
connects
 
factory
 
equipment
 
sensors
 
to
 
a
 
new
 
AI
 
predictive
 
maintenance
 
platform
 
using
 
default
 
passwords
 
and
 
unrestricted
 
network
 
access.
 
Real-life
 
basis:
 
Similar
 
to
 
the
 
2021
 
Florida
 
water
 
treatment
 
facility
 
incident
 
where
 
weak
 
security
 
controls
 
allowed
 
access
 
to
 
critical
 
systems,
 
though
 
in
 
that
 
case,
 
it
 
was
 
direct
 
hacking
 
rather
 
than
 
through
 
an
 
AI
 
system.
 
Risk
 
identification
 
exercise:
 
Participants
 
spot
 
inadequate
 
access
 
controls,
 
poor
 
authentication
 
practices,
 
and
 
lack
 
of
 
network
 
segmentation.
