Definition:
 
Harnessing
 
AI
 
to
 
understand
 
code
 
by
 
producing
 
plain-language
 
explanations
 
of
 
what
 
it
 
does
 
and
 
adding
 
in-line
 
comments
 
for
 
clarity .
 
Starter
 
Prompt:
 
Explain
 
what
 
the
 
following
 
function
 
does
 
and
 
how
 
it
 
works:
 
def
 
calculate_tax(income):
 
...
 
Executive
 
Prompt:
 
You
 
are
 
a
 
code
 
reviewer .
 
Explain
 
the
 
logic
 
of
 
the
 
following
 
function
 
step
 
by
 
step
 
in
 
simple
 
terms.
 
Then,
 
rewrite
 
the
 
function
 
with
 
in-line
 
comments
 
for
 
each
 
significant
 
step,
 
ensuring
 
it
 
retains
 
its
 
original
 
behavior .
 
Why
 
It
 
Works:
 
●
 
Sets
 
a
 
role
 
(code
 
reviewer)
 
and
 
requests
 
a
 
step-by-step
 
explanation,
 
prompting
 
the
 
AI
 
to
 
fully
 
articulate
 
the
 
code's
 
logic
 
before
 
giving
 
the
 
commented
 
version.
 
●
 
Combines
 
descriptive
 
output
 
(explanation)
 
with
 
a
 
concrete
 
result
 
(commented
 
code),
 
ensuring
 
the
 
AI
 
not
 
only
 
interprets
 
the
 
code
 
but
 
also
 
demonstrates
 
how
 
to
 
document
 
it.
 
Optional
 
Add-On:
 
Add
 
"Point
 
out
 
any
 
potential
 
issues
 
or
 
improvements
 
in
 
the
 
code
 
as
 
well."
 
to
 
get
 
deeper
 
insights
 
beyond
 
just
 
explanation.
