Quick-Look
 
Definition:
 
Creating
 
step-by-step
 
response
 
procedures
 
for
 
common
 
operational
 
scenarios.
 
Starter
 
Prompt:
 
How
 
should
 
we
 
respond
 
to
 
a
 
database
 
outage?
 
Executive
 
Prompt:
 
As
 
a
 
DevOps
 
architect,
 
create
 
a
 
detailed
 
incident
 
response
 
playbook
 
for
 
API
 
service
 
degradation.
 
Include:
 
1)
 
severity
 
classification
 
criteria,
 
2)
 
initial
 
diagnostic
 
commands
 
with
 
example
 
outputs,
 
3)
 
decision
 
tree
 
for
 
standard
 
failure
 
modes,
 
4)
 
remediation
 
steps
 
by
 
root
 
cause,
 
and
 
5)
 
stakeholder
 
communication
 
templates—format
 
as
 
a
 
runbook
 
with
 
clear
 
escalation
 
thresholds.
 
Why
 
It
 
Works:
 
●
 
Example
 
command
 
outputs
 
help
 
responders
 
accurately
 
interpret
 
results.
 
●
 
Communication
 
templates
 
prevent
 
critical
 
messaging
 
delays
 
during
 
incidents.
 
Optional
 
Add-On:
 
"Add
 
estimated
 
time-to-resolution
 
ranges
 
for
 
each
 
remediation
 
path."
