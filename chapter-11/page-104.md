Diagnosis
 
Quick-Look
 
Definition:
 
Interpreting
 
system
 
logs
 
to
 
identify
 
error
 
patterns
 
and
 
root
 
causes.
 
Starter
 
Prompt:
 
Explain
 
the
 
root
 
cause
 
of
 
these
 
Kubernetes
 
pod
 
restart
 
logs.
 
Executive
 
Prompt:
 
You
 
are
 
an
 
SRE.
 
Analyze
 
the
 
log
 
excerpt,
 
pinpoint
 
the
 
failure,
 
suggest
 
a
 
one-line
 
fix,
 
and
 
then
 
draft
 
a
 
post-mortem
 
blurb
 
(Impact,
 
Cause,
 
Action).
 
Why
 
It
 
Works:
 
●
 
One-line
 
fix
 
constraint
 
forces
 
practical
 
solutions
 
over
 
theoretical
 
analysis.
 
●
 
Post-mortem
 
format
 
ensures
 
documentation
 
for
 
knowledge
 
sharing.
 
Optional
 
Add-On:
 
"Include
 
a
 
CloudW atch
 
alert
 
rule
 
to
 
catch
 
this
 
earlier
 
next
 
time."
