Starter
 
Prompt:
 
Give
 
me
 
five
 
ways
 
to
 
market
 
my
 
organic

line.
 
Executive
 
Prompt:
 
You
 
are
 
a
 
marketing
 
strategist.
 
For
 
a
 
new
 
home
 
workout
 
equipment
 
line,
 
develop
 
six
 
distinct
 
positioning
 
angles:
 
2
 
emotion-based,
 
two
 
feature-based,
 
and
 
two
 
competitor-comparative.
 
For
 
each
 
angle,
 
provide
 
1)
 
a
 
headline,
 
2)
 
a
 
main
 
audience
 
segment,
 
3)
 
a
 
core
 
message,
 
and
 
4)
 
a
 
channel
 
recommendation.
 
Why
 
It
 
Works:
 
●
 
Forced
 
diversity
 
in
 
angles
 
prevents
 
falling
 
back
 
on
 
obvious
 
approaches.
 
●
 
Audience-message-channel
 
alignment
 
ensures
 
the
 
delivery
 
of
 
practical,
 
targeted
 
ideas.
 
Optional
 
Add-On:
 
"For
 
each
 
positioning
 
angle,
 
include
 
one
 
data
 
point
 
or
 
proof
 
element
 
that
 
would
 
strengthen
 
credibility ."
