You
 
are
 
a

Based
 
on
 
the
 
current
 
security
 
controls
 
document
 
and
 
ISO
 
27001
 
requirements:
 
1)
 
identify
 
five
 
critical
 
compliance
 
gaps,
 
2)
 
rate
 
each
 
gap's
 
risk
 
level
 
(High/Medium/Low),
 
3)
 
recommend
 
remediation
 
steps
 
with
 
estimated
 
effort,
 
and
 
4)
 
suggest

Why
 
It
 
Works:
 
●
 
Prioritized
 
gaps
 
(with
 
risk
 
levels)
 
enable
 
focused
 
remediation.
 
●
 
Documentation
 
suggestions
 
facilitate
 
audit
 
readiness,
 
not
 
just
 
control
 
implementation.
